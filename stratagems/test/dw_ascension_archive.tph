/////   This contains various functions used by DavidW to build
/////   resources needed by Ascension. They're heavily dependent
/////   on the 'SFO' function library and environment in SCS.
/////
/////   Since they're not adaptive code, I run them offline and
/////   ship the result, so as not to have to package that library
/////   and environment with Ascension. But they're here for reference.
/////   
/////   To use this file, include it in an SCS component (or a
/////   component of another mod with SCS's coding environment)
/////   and include it with the 'include' function.
