Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on the average.  As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges.  Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length.  The former resulted in what is now called the long bow.

This particular bow is made from an unusual wood from southern lands, much sought by bowyers: despite its small size, it is as accurate as a longbow and slightly more powerful.

The axe blade is balanced at the rear with a fluke, and surmounted by a sharp spike, usually of quadrangular design.  The fluke is sometimes replaced by a hook used to dismount cavalry.  A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.

@413 = ~Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand.  Maces and flails are two previous examples of this - the war hammer is another.  The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer.  It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long.

This is a particularly fine war hammer. Its head is balanced perfectly so that the wielders weight and strength are concentrated on the target and so that it can be swung accurately without compromising the force of a blow.

@417 = ~Also known as the hand-and-a-half sword, the bastard sword derives its name from the fact that it is halfway between the two-handed sword and the long sword. The bastard sword has a double-edged blade and a long grip, which can accommodate both hands if preferred.  The overall length of the bastard sword ranges between four feet and four feet ten inches.

There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

This particular longsword is unusually finely made. Its balance is near perfect, and its blade runs to an edge of razor sharpness.

However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length.  The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

@423=~One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.

Most spears are crude, mass-produced weapons, but unusual care has been lavished on this one. The head is made of high-quality steel and the balance is very fine.

@427=~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword.  Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons.  In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened.  Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword.  The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.  This one is particularly good at its job, as it has been crafted of the finest dwarven steel.

@605=~SCS Ease-of-Use AI : ~
@606=~The AI has 5 functions:

1) The character will fight, prioritising opponents who are not immobile and helpless, not fighting if they're trying to Turn Undead, and not wasting Melf's Minute Meteors, Energy Blades or 
Invisibility. You can shift the character between melee (D) and ranged weapons (F) using the hotkeys. If you'd rather that your character did not enter melee, you can toggle melee off by pressing (K). Characters with melee toggled off will fight if enemies are in weapon range but won't be proactive about getting into range.

2) The character will cast some long-duration spells when out of combat. There are 4 settings for this, which you can toggle through using (S). On setting 1, the character uses no spells. On setting 2 and up, the character will cast all of the following spells if they are memorized (and not already active): Stoneskin, Iron Skins, Armor, Melf's Minute Meteors, Goodberry. 

3) On setting 2 and up, the character will consume Goodberries if injured and out of combat. On setting 3 and up, the character will also consume potions of healing. On setting 4, the character will consume potions of extra-healing.

4) On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically activate the following items once per day: the Cloak of the Stars; the Gargoyle Boots; the Belt of Fortitude.

5) On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically cast low-level healing spells on the party if they have them. The casting is highly accelerated and cannot be done in combat; characters will only cast healing spells of a level 2 or more below the highest level of spells which they can cast.

6) The character will cast some spells, by hotkey, on the whole party. This casting is highly accelerated, cannot be done in combat, and only casts on characters who are not already protected. Its main function is for later in the game when you can afford to carry enough spells to protect the whole party. The hot-keys are: C for Chaotic Commands; V for Death Ward; B for Protection from Fire, Protection from Lightning, and Protection from Magic Energy; Z for a paladin's Protection from Evil.~

The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process, that is more art form than anything else.  This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture, and normally made only by their weaponsmiths; how the drow came to forge this one is beyond you. Like most drow equipment, is created using Adamantine, an alloy of adamantite that quickly turns to dust if removed from the Underdark.

@3001=~Thanks for the tip, sucker! I'll just leave you here and be on my way!~
@3002=~Actually, I was wondering if you had a coil of rope that I could buy.~
@3003=~Rope?!~
@3004=~I don't know who you are, stranger, but I can tell  that you're an adventurer, and I can tell by the way the soldiers look at you that you're some force to be reckoned with. Your equipment is probably worth more than this village, and what do you want to buy? A coil of rope. Perhaps the gods do have a sense of humour.~
@3005=~Here is your rope, my good <MANWOMAN>. There is no charge - I'll be dining out on this story for weeks.~
@3006=~Can I interest you in my wares, my <LADYLORD>?~
@3007=~I was hoping to buy some rope from you.~
@3008=~You'd better have some rope, fool, or you're a dead man.~
@3009=~Ummm... yes, I do happen to have some rope here.~
@3010=~There would be a charge, but looking at what you did to poor Zakee, I don't think I'll be levying it...~
@3011=~I discovered one of Balthazar's followers imprisoned here.  Before he died the monk explained how I can find and defeat Abazigal.  I need to find the Scroll of Reversal to break the geas that both enslaves a dragon guardian and seals the entrance to Abazigal's inner enclave.

The caverns here are all connected by underwater tunnels.  Luckily I now have some more of the water breathing potion to allow me to explore the various tunnels.  Like it or not, I guess I'm going spelunking... just as soon as I can get hold of a rope. It seems silly to have to trek back to Amkethran for something so mundane, but I guess I don't have a lot of choice... what else is new, though?~

@3040 = ~Ithy'nassendra, are you a dragon or a swamp lizard? Bhaalspawn or no, this is a paltry mammal. It is no match for even one of us.~
@3041 = ~And, if it is the Bhaalspawn, and on the off chance it defeats you, I'll be sure to avenge you. Have fun!~
@3042 = ~You *are* the Bhaalspawn. No other could have done this. But god-child or no, you will not withstand my assault.~
@3043 = ~Um... I don't suppose you'd care to negotiate?~
@3044 = ~I don't know if you noticed, but there are four dead dragons here, including Draconis. What makes you think you'll be any different?~
@3045 = ~Let's get this over with, then.~
@3046 = ~We are far past that stage, <PRO_RACE>. You have nothing to offer me, and I have no choice but to attack. I fear Abazigal's wrath more than death itself.~
@3047 = ~But you are tired and wounded, and I am fresh to the fight... and it matters not in any case, for I fear Abazigal's wrath more than death itself.~

@3056 = ~Draconis is dead, yes.~

@3058 = ~Die, wyrm!~
@3059 = ~I admire your directness, <PRO_RACE>, if not your manners. So be it, then - in my wretched state, I welcome diversions.~
@3060 = ~I am delighted to hear it. The cur was a disgrace to dragon-kind greater even than his mongrel father. But now, Bhaalspawn, what is it that brings you to my cave?~
@3061 = ~Great dragon, you honour me with your words. I seek some way to explore these caves further - there is a potion which will allow me to travel through the waterways. Might you grant us the boon of your aid as well as your magnificent presence?~
@3062 = ~I'm not interested in bantering. I just want to get at that potion pool behind you.~
@3063 = ~No more words, dragon, it's time to die!~
@3064 = ~Um, actually I think I may have taken a wrong turning. You haven't seen a couple of bone fiends anywhere around, have you?~
@3065 = ~Bhaalspawn, fallen and humiliated I may be, but I am not so addled in wits to be that easily fooled. What is it that you want?~
@3066 = ~How I have fallen. Banished to this miserable, damp cave, forced to protect a stagnant pool. I am a guard dog, not a dragon.~
@3067 = ~Truly, mighty dragon, your splendour shines forth even in these poor surroundings. I am honoured to gaze upon your magnificent form.~
@3068 = ~I'm not interested in your snivelling, wyrm. Get out of my way and let me get at the potion.~
@3069 = ~Well, wyrm, it sounds as if you're between me and my goal. That means it's time for you to die!~
@3070 = ~Your flattery would once have been welcome to me, <PRO_RACE>. But I am a wretched creature now - defeated and humiliated by a mongrel halfbreed, my home invaded, my hoard stolen away from me, my pride humbled. Now I am banished to this miserable, damp cave, forced to protect this stagnant pool. I am a guard dog, not a dragon, and dogs have no need for flattery.~
@3071 = ~Perhaps I can restore your pride, great dragon. If you only allow me passage to the Breath Potion, I would be honoured to slay Abazigal on your behalf.~
@3072 = ~Your flattery would once have been welcome to me, <PRO_RACE>. But I am a wretched creature now - defeated and humiliated by a mongrel halfbreed, my hoard stolen away from me, my pride humbled. Dogs have no need for flattery.~
@3073 = ~Then get out of my way, you pathetic excuse for a dragon.~
@3074 = ~How dare you speak to a dragon that way, <PRO_RACE>? I may be laid low, but I still have my fangs and my claws, and I will teach you to respect our kind!~
@3075 = ~Your words are courteous, <PRO_RACE>, and I would like to believe them. But can you really defeat Abazigal? If I give you the potion, he will know of it, I am sure.~
@3076 = ~But I will give you a chance to prove your worth. If you can defeat me in combat, maybe you will have a chance with the mongrel usurper. And if not, then perhaps the diversion of battle will provide some respite to my misery. Defend yourself, Bhaalspawn.~
@3077 = ~I yield! Truly I am impressed, <PRO_RACE>. I have lived over a thousand years, and not once has one of your kind bested me. Perhaps you can slay the usurper after all. I will honour our bargain.~
@3078 = ~You honour me with your words, great dragon - I have faced no more worthy opponent.~
@3079 = ~Enough talking, dragon. You're beaten, now just let me at the potion.~
@3080 = ~I don't think so. I'd rather just finish you off - even if you don't have a hoard, I'm sure your skin will be good for something.~
@3081 = ~How dare you speak to a dragon that way, <PRO_RACE>? Would that I could tear you apart... but you are more than my match. Curse all Bhaalspawn. Take your wretched potion, then. May it choke you.~
@3082 = ~As courteous as you are powerful, Bhaalspawn. Take it, then, with my blessing, and take this as well. And slay the wretched mongrel who has stolen my home and my pride away!~
@3083 = ~Ingrate! To the death, then, Bhaalspawn - perhaps I yet may tear you apart.~
@3084 = ~The mongrel usurper is dead! You have done me a great service this day, Bhaalspawn. But now I wish to rest, and think,and perhaps sleep. Leave this place with my blessing.~
@3085 = ~We have no further business, <PRO_RACE>.~
@3086 = ~I am sorry to have disturbed you, mighty dragon.~
@3087 = ~Is that all you've got to say for yourself?~

@3089 = ~How dare you speak to a dragon that way, <PRO_RACE>? Would that I could tear you apart... but you are more than my match. Curse all Bhaalspawn.~
@3090 = ~Go, then, and leave me to my sleep.~

@4100=~The Holy Avenger: Carsomyr
Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

@5000=~Insect Plague
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Sphere: Animal
Range: Long
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a mass of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm, first attacking the target, and then moving on to all enemies of the caster within the spell's radius. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death or run away in fear. If a successful save vs. breath at -4 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.

This spell is blocked by any form of fire shield.~

@5001=~Creeping Doom
Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Sphere: Animal
Range: Long
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a horde of venomous biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d6 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death at -2 or run away in fear. If a successful save vs. breath at -6 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.

This spell is blocked by any form of fire shield.~

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of +4 or better enchantment.  This spell is incredibly powerful yet has a very short duration, and this combined with the very short casting time makes this spell useful only in the thick of intense combat.  It is also important to note that this spell will not work in conjuction with protection from magic weapons.  This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@5301=~Improved Mantle (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of +5 or better enchantment.  This spell is incredibly powerful hence the duration is so short.  However, the casting time is also very short making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.  It is important to note that this spell does not work in combination with protection from magic weapons.  This spell lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~

@20702=~No, Khalid, it is *not* wise. But <CHARNAME> leads this group, and Gorion would wish us to help him. We will meet again soon.~

@20703=~Khalid, a successful group needs to be light and small, and not everyone's skills can be used at once. I need you in the party... but I must ask you to travel without Jaheira.~

@20705=~I doubt very much whether this is wise, <CHARNAME>. But this is your group to lead, for better or for worse. Tymora be with you, Khalid - we will meet again soon.~

@20707=~Minsc and Boo and Dynaheir are a team! And one which takes up very little space. We should remain together!~
@20708=~Nay, Minsc, we should respect <CHARNAME>'s judgement. We owe <PRO_HIMHER> much. Fare thee well, I shall be safe here and we will meet again before long.~

@20709=~We'd be grateful for your magic and your wisdom... but we don't have space for another warrior right now - even one with Minsc's... unique... talents. Would he be willing to remain behind?~

@20712=~YOUR services? Aye, that I do. But we have no place amongst us for that mad wizard.~
@20713=~Mad? Mad, you say? I am no more mad than the bodies in the crypt. See them cavort beneath the earth. They are dancing.~
@20714=~You would maybe have a point. Let it be so, then - for now at least. Keep yerself well, wizard - we'll meet again soon enough, I've no doubt.~
@20715=~I prefer my families a little smaller. I've room for you, but Montaron I don't need.~
@20716=~Oh, Monty, they don't love you no more! But what can I do? Keep yourself well, I'm off with these folk. Byeeee!~
@20717=~As you wish. No good'll come of it, though - you'll be crawling back soon enough, I don't doubt. Begone, wizard - I'll be glad for a few days respite from your prattling.~
@20718=~(Quietly) Frankly, I'll be glad for a respite from the mewling little brat. One second...~
@20719=~Skie, darling, <CHARNAME> tells me it's going to be dangerous travelling for the next few days. I don't want you to get hurt... I think you'd better stay out of harm's way for a while. Never fear, I'll come safely back to you.~
@20720=~But... Eldoth... I-...~
@20721=~Well, I suppose you know best. And it's sweet of you to care so much. Stay safe and hurry home!~
@20722=~Is that really a good idea? Eldoth looks after me, you know. And he's terribly brave!~
@20723=~(Quietly) Thank Cyric, a chance for a respite from that brat.~
@20724=~Skie, you should trust your own skills. You'll be fine darling. Safe journey, and remember our love!~
@20725=~You're very welcome to rejoin. But Eldoth should stay here for now - we don't have room for him at the moment, despite his... talents.~
@20726=~I have to admit, we do need you. Not Skie, though - she stays right here.~
@20801=~I don't need your help right now, but we'll travel together again soon. Until then, wait for me at the Friendly Arm Inn.~
@20802=~For the time being we should each seek our own destiny. I'll need your help again soon enough, though - if you take lodgings in the Nashkel Inn, I'll meet you there when I'm next in the south.~
@20803=~We should separate now. I'll look you up next time I'm in the Gate - meet me in the Elfsong Tavern.~
@20804=~Our paths must run apart for a while. If I should need your help again, though, we should rendezvous at the Jovial Juggler in Beregost.~

@20810=~It would be an honour.~
@20811=~Well sure. I won't get into any trouble while you're gone, no sir.~
@20812=~As it happens, I do have some business in them parts. Look me up there if you ever need any more dwarven muscle.~
@20813=~Very well, I accept under the terms of our agreement. (Best to humour them, they're not bright enough to understand the arguments against the idea.)~
@20814=~I will chafe at the inaction, but I am deeply in your debt. Return soon to this war priest.~
@20815=~Of course, darling. I'm sure I'll be able to find amusements there in your absence.~
@20816=~Well, my song could do with a few days quiet work. Hurry back, though - there's far more to be seen, I'm sure!~
@20817=~Even the best things pass away, they say, but perhaps they may pass back? I will await the time when our paths cross once more.~
@20818=~I will do this thing, but much remains to be done. Do not delay your return.~
@20819=~It's been good being with you. But I'm sure you're acting wisely... Still, there's much left to be done, so let's work together again soon.~
@20820=~It makes no difference either way. I can await death as easily in one place as in another.~
@20821=~Awww... do I have to? I don't wanna go there... but I suppose I'll do what ya say. I'll sulk till you return though!~
@20822=~I see little prospect of protecting Nature by huddling under a roof of dead wood, surrounded by all the squalor of Man. It is a mark of my trust in you that I will do as you say.~
@20823=~That seems a remarkably stupid idea. But I suppose the only way of convincing you of that is to play along with it.~
@20824=~I will do so, but I hope to rejoin you soon. I do not yet hold my debt repayed.~
@20825=~Tiax is pleased by your creative subservience. Upon your return, the lowly denizens of this inn will be worshipping the glory that is Tiax!~
@20826=~I will do this, but not willingly. I am far from safe in these dwellings of surface folk.~

@20831=~Yes, O omnipresent authority figure.~
@20832=~V-v-v-very well, then. Good luck on your travels.~
@20833=~If thou dost desire it, then I shall do so. Thou hast proven thyself to be quite the leader, and by now I have confidence in thy decisions.~
@20834=~Are you sure? Boo does not think that there is much evil to be mercilessly pummelled in an inn. But then evil is very clever, and often well educated, and can hide anywhere. We will see you soon.~
@20835=~Hooray! A way in which I can be useful to our happy family! And without having to spend any more time in the company of fools.~
@20836=~As ye would have it. Some time away from ye will be good for us all, in any case.~
@20837=~Okay - I guess this sort of thing is part of what adventurers do too, though it doesn't sound interesting...~
@20838=~A chance for a little luxury and a rest from the road? I shan't turn it down.~

@20840=~Certainly! I have several days worth of reading that I should be catching up with. I do look forward to when we can travel together again, though!~

There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@21609=~Such generosity, but if you leave you will exterminate anyway. Others will come, other fools just to fight the "evil" we are. No, we must remain alone here now, and so must you.

@21610=~Kaishas, there is no need for this. This isn't my choice, but we'll kill you if we have to. Do you really think you can stop us where Karoug and Daese couldn't?~
@21611=~ I... fear that we cannot. But we shall try. No choice remains to us.~
@21612=~Kaishas, this is insane. You are going to your death, and I don't even want to kill you!~

I have reluctantly fought with Kaishas. She seemed to think there was no other way. She mentioned they might have a second chance if Selaad returned one day. He was their missing chieftain, if I remember correctly.~

@21626=~And now I do. Prepare yourself, Kaishas - this ends now.~
@21627=~This grows ridiculous. Your ingratitude sickens me - I'd hoped that I wouldn't need to see you as a monster, but it looks as if I was wrong.~
@21628=~Kaishas, do you take me for a fool? I knew you were werewolves before I even spoke to Karoug... frankly I was damn suspicious within five minutes of entering the village! If you're going to try to kill us then go right ahead, but for Ao's sake give us some credit for intelligence!~
@21629=~I give you much credit, for intelligence and bravery both. Yet a headwoman's duty is all. I cannot risk that you lie.~
@21630=~Kaishas, please, wait! <CHARNAME> isn't lying! <PRO_HESHE> and I grew close... long after <PRO_HESHE> must have realised the truth about us! Spare <PRO_HIMHER> - <PRO_HESHE> may know our nature, but <PRO_HESHE> will keep our secret.~
@21631=~ I...~
@21632=~Kaishas, my Peladan is still alive because of these outsiders. Do I have to let him grow up knowing that we slaughtered Peladan's saviour? That we are monsters in truth as well as form?~
@21633=~I... I have been a fool. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, that I brought us to the brink of kinship with the beasts. But we are better than Karoug... thank you for knowing that, even as I forgot it.~
@21634=~Go, in peace. I do not know what will befall when you confront my husband. Greatly I fear for him, but he brings his fate upon himself. If he will not take back the gift willingly... then you must do what you must do.~
@21635=~One day, I hope, Peladan will have a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. <PRO_HISHER> name will be "<CHARNAME>".~
@21636=~We will never meet again, <CHARNAME> It.. grieves me. Remember me, even as you forget all else about our people.~
@21637=~I managed to persuade Kaishas Gan to let us leave in peace... with a bit of help from Delainy. A lovely girl, but some things are not meant to be, I suppose.~
@21638=~I managed to persuade Kaishas Gan to let us leave in peace... with a bit of help from Durlyle. There was something special between us... but some things are not meant to be, I suppose.~
@21639=~Indeed it does. Truly, I am sorry.~
@21640=~You shame me, outsider. Great is our debt to you. Yet a headwoman's duty is all. I cannot risk that you lie.~
@21641=~You have returned! And you are pack... I smell it on you. But where is Kaishas? Where is my mate?~
@21642=~Why did you send us? What was meant to happen on that island?~
@21643=~She remained on the island. Your mate would have killed us when we rejected the curse she laid upon us... but at the last she saw wisdom. Lift the "gift" from us and return to her, "Mendas". There is nothing here for you.~
@21644=~The log book was nothing! Balduran was nothing! He refused the gift that grandfathers offered him. You were only to give sea charts to Kaishas and kill Karoug so he could not follow. Kaishas would have brought pack here, where I have prepare place for them. Miserable ones! You could not accomplish such simple things? Instead you abandon my family and steal the boat to save your cruel selves?~
@21645=~It is time to end this banter now, Mendas. It is time that you pay for your lies and your evil. Prepare to die.~
@21646=~This ends here. Lift the "gift" from us, Mendas, and return to your mate. There is nothing here for you.~
@21647=~Dogs! You are not fit to die at my hand but die you shall! To me, Baresh! A bloody reckoning is at hand!~
@21648=~The Mysterious Island
The mystery of this island has become clear. Mendas/Selaad sent us to the island on the false pretenses of retrieving evidence from what was believed to be Balduran's shipwreck. It was indeed the adventurer's ship, though his personal fate yet remains a mystery. Balduran's crew were infected with lycanthropy sometime during that fateful voyage. The ship was beached and wrecked leaving the two strains of lycanthropes, werewolves and wolfweres, to fight amongst themselves for survival. The more organized werewolves built the village that we recently shipwrecked near on our own fateful voyage. The chaotic wolfweres took residence in the ruins of Balduran's ship and both packs survived in uneasy co-existence since then. Mendas/Selaad eventually took the risk of sailing for the mainland. Somehow he made it and, upon discovering that someone had finally found the island, made up a plausible tale and had us first steal the sea charts, and later travel to the island to put them in his werewolf mate's hands. She had us kill the wolfweres and then infected the party with lycanthropy, intending us to join the pack or die fighting, but we persuaded her to let us leave peacefully. We sailed home to finally discover the truth of Mendas' duplicity. Fate seems to enjoy toying with me.~
@21649=~I am puzzled, Mendas, or should I say Selaad. Since you are the leader of the werewolves, why did you not sail back to the island yourself?~
@21650=~I am no sailor. I stay to prepare place for my people. For generations we have been trapped on island. It is time to return home to the land of grandfathers' birth. They needed charts and I needed adventurers who do not ask too much questions. Yet you have failed. I ask again - where is Kaishas?~
@21651=~"Lift" it? My foolish mate, what have you told them? It is not a curse to be lifted - it is a gift to be savoured! It can only be "cured" by killing the chieftain of the werewolves. I am chieftain and I judge you unworthy to run with my pack. You will die here today. To me Baresh! A bloody reckoning is at hand!~
@21652=~Selaad Gan is the chief of the true people. He awaits the return of his mate Kaishas. Why have you not returned with her?~
@21653=~It is not your place to question me. What part do you play in this?~
@21654=~It seems that we have been deceived. Kaishas is dead and her murderous ilk died with her.~
@21655=~We were hired to retrieve the logbook of Balduran. Here we have brought it and now we expect payment.~
@21656=~It seems that we have been deceived. Kaishas remains on the island. We must confront Selaad and have him remove this curse which his mate has foolishly bestowed upon us.~
@21657=~The master wishes to see his wife, Kaishas Gan. Is she on the vessel still?~
@21658=~It is not your business. Step aside.~
@21659=~Who is your master? We work for Mendas of Waterdeep.~
@21660=~I am Baresh. I am of the true race as you are not. The master wishes to see his wife, Kaishas Gan. Is she on the vessel still?~
@21661=~The book is nothing! Thy task was to rescue the master's kin. Where is the master's mate, Kaishas?~
@21662=~Thy task was clear. Travel to the island-home and retrieve master's kin. Failing that, Kaishas was to take the sea charts from thee. Useless manlings! Selaad does not brook failure well.~
@21663=~Idiot! We were sent on false pretences and somehow it is our fault? Kaishas attacked us and we were forced to defend ourselves. Mendas was betrayed by his own cleverness.~
@21664=~Mendas deceived us. He is the one that we must confront. You are merely a flunky.~
@21665=~Idiot! We were sent on false pretences and somehow it is our fault? Now, take us to Selaad!~
@21666=~Useless wretch! The master will eat thy marrow for this!~



@21701=~These old bones are slow... Long since Icharyd tasted blood...~
@21702=~But I have not walked Faerun this long without learning much... Not yet am I defeated...~
@21703=~Myrkul, honour our pact... remember the blood I spilled for thee. Aid me!~
@21704=~You feel strangely tired after the battle with the undead knight... as if time had moved more swiftly in the world beyond Ulcaster while the battle raged. Looking around, you see dawn's light break over the ruins.~
@21705=~Wolf of Ulcaster~
@21706=~aroooouuuuuuu~
@21707=~Howl of Terror~
@21708=~Howl of the Grave~
@21709=~Howl of Disenchantment~
@21710=~Howl of Ill Fate~

@21801=~You feel the air around you shimmer as the last of the elemental guardians falls. Those amongst you familiar with the arcane arts recognise that a dimensional gateway is forming. Within a few moments you will be transported somewhere else - further into the Tower, no doubt - and an inner voice tells you that it may be as well to prepare yourselves...~

@21901=~Shennara~
@21902=~Kaalos~
@21903=~Aye, I guess, but I'll not be long about it. The acolytes I mentioned, they stay with Thaldorn on the fifth floor. Eight of them, there are, and their madness comes in pairs: two priests, two mages, two assassins, two hardened thugs. But there is something wrong about them... if they were here for the simple joys of a pretty coin, I'd have no quarrel with them. But no: they would not deign to be so human. There is something more, some secret agenda and I know not what... Ack, even now I can feel their pestilential eyes upon me. Your lucre can keep me here no longer, I'm afraid.~
@21904=~Mmn, hello. You must be the city negotiators... Lemme see on the list, here: Emissary... Emissary Tar? Right on time and a pleasure to meet you. My name is Destus Gurn, Assistant Chief Accountant for the Iron Throne's operations on the Sword Coast. Now, just a quick briefing on our negotiating procedures before you head on up the stairs: Thaldorn will be accompanied by a board of eight Iron Throne advisors sent to us from abroad: Zhalimar Cloudwulfe, Gardush, Naaman, Diyab, Shennara, Kaalos, Aasim, and Alai, all of them quite respectable people and eager to meet you. We also have a ninth member on that board, today, a Mr. Lyle Espejo. He is there to ensure that things go smoothly in this time of transition. As for the agenda...~
@21905=~Those before us were fools, as you are.  Those before us were weak, as you are.  Those before us were not Zhalimar, or Gardush, or Naaman, or Diyab, or Shennara, or Kaalos, or Aasim, or Alai.  Those before us are dead, as you will be.  So it has been decreed; so it shall be done.  So orders Sarevok!~
@21906=~I am sorry to bring back such painful memories.  I wish to help you, and in doing so, end these dreams that plague me.  Here, take this.  When you do battle against the eight who serve your father's killer, read this scroll and it will protect you from their wrath.  Goodbye now; perhaps we shall meet again.~


@22001=~You cannot hide from me, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. Your death is inevitable.~
@22002=~Oh, my foolish <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... You have no power to harm me. Do you think I chose to confront you in this place through some sense of theater?~
@22003=~Our dead father's strength suffuses these walls! Here I was to perform the rituals that would make me a god, and here I have already mastered power beyond your puny imaginings. What I began with Zhalimar and the others whom you struck down in Rieltar's mansion, I have now completed.~
@22004=~These four are my acolytes, the first of my worshippers. While we are within this place, their souls are bound to our father's taint within me. Their power suffuses me, protects me from all harm. It is but a taste of what I shall wield when I ascend, but for now it is more than sufficient to end this little family quarrel.~
@22005=~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I shall not allow your death to be swift.~
@22006=~A predictable ploy, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. And impressive, as well, but ultimately futile. I have three others - and before too long, I will have legions.~
@22007=~But until then, one must not be wasteful. Come, my acolyte! Your body shall serve me yet!~
@22008=~Does it end here, then, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>? You have taken my acolytes, taken my shield from harm. Am I not to become a god?~
@22009=~No! I deny it! I am Sarevok! I AM LORD OF MURDER!~
@22010=~Diarmid~


@22201=~Ho there, <CHARNAME>! Your foster father Gorion tells me that you need to leave the Keep at once. Your very life is in danger and there is no time to lose.~
@22202=~But before then, it's probably a good idea if you go round the Keep in a leisurely fashion finding lost property and running errands, all for an economically implausible cash reward and an astonishing amount of experience.~
@22203=~Sounds good, I'm on it.~
@22204=~Can't I just get the cash and experience right now? The longer I wait, the higher the chance that those first-level assassins in the Keep will finish me off.~
@22205=~Good luck, <CHARNAME>, and watch out for those rats. See you in Chapter Six.~
@22206=~I don't see why not. How much are you really going to learn about spell-throwing and swordplay by fetching crossbow bolts, after all?~
@22207=~Here's the cash and a couple of potions, and some random junk that you can probably sell to someone. Go do your shopping, then I'll take you to Gorion.~
@22208=~Ready to go, <CHARNAME>?~
@22209=~Yep, take me to Gorion.~
@22210=~No, I haven't finished shopping yet.~
@22211=~Actually, I thought I'd go and do all the quests anyway, and get twice the experience.~
@22212=~Right this way.~
@22213=~Very well, <CHARNAME>, but get a move on, I don't have all day.~
@22214=~In any case, you don't realise just how dangerous it is here for you. Those bounty hunters can do up to one point of damage per blow!~
@22215=~I understand completely, <CHARNAME>. Greater heroes than you have fallen to temptation at the prospect of getting two Lynx Eye Gems.~

@22401=~<CHARNAME>, I feel a dweomer building... we should prepare ourselves, we will soon be taken from this place. (Not that these simians could tell a dweomer from a doorknob - perhaps I should have used shorter words?)~

@22402=~Dost thou not sense it? Magics swirl around us - we will be gone from this place ere long. And into worse dangers still, I doubt it not.~

@22403=~I feel magics building... I don't think we'll be in this place much longer. Not that it's important, though - it doesn't matter where we die, after all.~

@22404=~<CHARNAME>, I may be new to this magic stuff, but even I can feel a spell this powerful. I think it's some sort of teleportation - maybe we're going to be taken somewhere else? Do you think we ought to get ready, or something - I'd really like to think it's somewhere friendly, but nowhere else in this tower has been!~

@22405=~What's that I feel? Oooh, how exciting?~

@22406=~Is it a teleportation spell? Why yes, it is!~

@22407=~Are we going to be here much longer? Not likely...~

@22408=~Are we going somewhere more dangerous? Who knows?~

@22409=~It's quite obvious to the meanest intelligence - yours, that is - what will happen next. If you weren't as insensitive to magic as a clod of earth, you'd feel the teleportation spell building. Doubtless we're en route to more tedious monsters.~

@22410=~ I suppose there's no point hoping that you'd think of preparing for them without my reminders? No, probably not.~


@22500=~Well, if it ain't the fine hunter who brought me that winter wolf pelt! Can I interest you in anything in my humble shop?~
@22501=~Yes, what do you have for sale?~
@22502=~Nothing right now.~
@22503=~Well, if it isn't another winter wolf pelt! Thing is, I had a buyer lined up for the last one... don't think I can be taking another one off your hands right now. Maybe some trader a bit closer to civilization could help you out. But perhaps I can interest you in something else?~
@22504=~Perhaps. What do you have for sale?~
@22505=~Not right now.~
@22506=~You might have cleared out Firewine Bridge, but there's more than one ogre mage on the Sword Coast who can see why Jenkal is worth keeping around!~
@22507=~A short way down this low, narrow corridor, it is blocked by a sturdy iron door that has been barred from the other side. You will have to find another way around.~
@22508=~Winter Wolf Pelts
The Merchant of Nashkel has promised us gold if we were to bring back a winter wolf pelt.~
