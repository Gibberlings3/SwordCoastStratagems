-----1230 Expanded Actions [M]
Enables the use of new actions

Descriptions
352 LoseGame()
Plays the ending cutscene as if the protagonist died. If the action is used in a pausing dialogue, the ending cutscene will play after the dialogue ends. This action does nothing in the arenas game type.

353 DialogueSetGlobal(S:Name*,S:Area*,I:Value*)
Sets the variable 'Name' in the scope 'Area' to 'Value' immediately instead of being added through the dialogue owner's action queue. This allows variables to be set instantaneously and checked immediately afterwards in the same dialogue. ActionOverride() is supported. If used outside dialogue, this action behaves exactly as SetGlobal().
Limitations: Variables become set asynchronously to the order in which the action is present on the script block. This can cause issues when an action is purposely sandwiched between two modifications of the same variable.

354 DialogueIncrementGlobal(S:Name*,S:Area*,I:Value*)
Increments the variable 'Name' in the scope 'Area' by 'Value' immediately instead of being added through the dialogue owner's action queue. This allows variables to be set instantaneously and checked immediately afterwards in the same dialogue. ActionOverride() is supported. If used outside dialogue, this action behaves exactly as IncrementGlobal().
Limitations: Variables become set asynchronously to the order in which the action is present on the script block. This can cause issues when an action is purposely sandwiched between two modifications of the same variable.

355 DialogueSG(S:Name*,I:Num*)
Sets the global variable 'Name' to 'Num' immediately instead of being added through the dialogue owner's action queue. This allows variables to be set instantaneously and checked immediately afterwards in the same dialogue. ActionOverride() is supported. If used outside dialogue, this action behaves exactly as SG().
Limitations: Variables become set asynchronously to the order in which the action is present on the script block. This can cause issues when an action is purposely sandwiched between two modifications of the same variable.

Parameter #1: Statistic Modifier
Parameter #2: Type

2   Percentage Modifier -> Luck = (Luck * 'Statistic Modifier' value) / 100

3   Cumulative Modifier -> Value = Value + 'Statistic Modifier' value

For a non-permanent timing, the instantaneous cumulative modifier immediately adds the 'Statistic Modifier' value, unlike the cumulative modifier which adds the 'Statistic Modifier' after all effects are applied. The former has the disadvantage that it will be overriden by any subsequent flat value modifiers. Percentage modifiers override all other modifiers.

-----600 Remove Projectile Mod [M]
Enabled the use of the remove specific area effect to allow custom 2DAs to be used in the Resource field.

Description
#273 (0x111)  Remove: Specific Area Effect(Zone of Sweet Air) [273]
Parameter #1: Mode
Parameter #2: Undetermined
Description:
If Mode is not 1, removes projectiles listed in clearair.2da and smoke of animation ID 0x5*0 (standard behaviour).
If Mode is 1, removes projectiles and smoke animations listed in the 2da resource specified in the Resource field.
If the custom resource is invalid, standard behaviour occurs as if Mode is 0.

The recommended format of the custom 2da resources are as follows:
2DA V1.00
*
		Projectile Number		Smoke Animation
<PROJECTILE_NAME>	94			*			//for projectile only
<PROJECTILE_NAME>	*			0X0500			//for smoke animation only
<PROJECTILE_NAME>	186			0X0600			//for projectile and smoke animation

Note that the smoke animation ID must be specified in hexadecimal, with capital X and must be 4 hexadecimal digits.
The third digit of the target smoke animation ID is ignored, e.g. 0X0500 will remove smoke animation IDs 0x05*0.

-----1130 Save Vs Breath Mod [F, M]
Fixes a bug so that the save value correctly limits to -20 or 20, rather than a net negative save value wrapping to 20
Adds instantaneous sum type (3)

Description
#36 (0x024)  Stat: Save vs. Breath Weapons Modifier [36]
Parameter #1: Statistic Modifier
Parameter #2: Type
Description:
Applies the modifier value specified by the 'Statistic Modifier' field in the style specified by the 'Type' field.

Known values for 'Type' are:
0   Cumulative Modifier -> Save = Save + 'Statistic Modifier' value
1   Flat Value Modifier -> Save = 'Statistic Modifier' value
2   Percentage Modifier -> Save = (Save * 'Statistic Modifier' value) / 100
3   Instantaneous Cumulative Modifier -> Save = Save + 'Statistic Modifier' value

'Statistic Modifier' can be positive or negative.

For a non-permanent timing, the instantaneous cumulative modifier immediately adds the 'Statistic Modifier' value, unlike the cumulative modifier which adds the 'Statistic Modifier' after all effects are applied. The former has the disadvantage that it will be overriden by any subsequent flat value modifiers. Percentage modifiers override all other modifiers.

-----480 Strength Mod [F, M, X]
Fixes a bug so that a net negative strength value will limit to 0 rather than wrap to 25
Alters the strength modifier effect opcode to work similar to Icewind Dale behaviour

Description
#44 (0x02C)  Stat: Strength Modifier [44]
Parameter #1: Statistic Modifier
Parameter #2: Type
Description:
Applies the modifier value specified by the 'Statistic Modifier' field in the style specified by the 'Type' field.

Known values for 'Type' are:
0 Cumulative Modifier -> Strength = Strength + 'Statistic Modifier' value
1 Flat Value Modifier -> Strength = 'Statistic Modifier' value
2 Percentage Modifier -> Strength = (Strength * 'Statistic Modifier' value) / 100
3 Strength Spell

For a Type of 3 (Strength Spell), strength is modified as per Icewind Dale Strength spell behaviour, externalised to CLSSPLAB.2DA, in which 1Dx strength is gained up to a maximum of 18/<STREX value> depending on the player's class (defaults to 1D6 if class is not present), where x is specified by the STR column. Unit increments between 18 and 19 depend on differences detected in the STRMODEX.2DA table. The 'Statistic Modifier' value overrides the CLSSPLAB.2DA entry, specifying the die size and allowing a maximum strength of 18/00.

FlameWing's description of Strength Spell:
"IWD1/P&P Strength Spell With a slight change, in that param1 != 0 means dice size to roll for all classes and allows exceptional strength bonuses for non-warrior classes. For example, param1 = 4 rolls a d4 for strength increase,
similar to P&P Strength of Stone spell. In all cases, strength cannot become 19 or more."

-New stats 202-400 are reserved for hard-coded stats
-New stats can be checked correctly using CheckStat(), CheckStatLT(), and CheckStatGT() script triggers
-New stats are not permanent, they require an ongoing effect opcode 318 in order to keep their values
-In order to make a new stat semi-permanent, you can set an extremely long duration for the effect, or use timing mode 10 and set duration to INT_MAX (2147483647)
-New stats will only be saved in saved games if stored as an effect opcode 318
-Actions cannot directly set the value of new stats (they will not keep); use an action to trigger effect opcode 318 if actions are required

-----900 Targetting Dead Animations Fix [F]
Fixes a broad bug where the dead creatures that are not transferred to the middle vertical list can be targetted by AI, triggers and actions

Brief Explanation
Vertical lists are implemented by areas to determine drawing order
There are three vertical lists: LIST_FRONT, LIST_MIDDLE, LIST_BACK
AI targetting generally includes only active creatures in LIST_FRONT
When most creatures die, they are transferred from LIST_FRONT to LIST_MIDDLE
However, some creature animations are coded to disallow use of LIST_MIDDLE; when they die, they stay in LIST_FRONT
AI targetting does not account for this, and so dead creatures in LIST_FRONT can still be targetted by AI, triggers and actions (e.g. AttackReevaluate)
Animations affected by this are: 0x6404 SAREVOK, 0x4XXX STATIC_* (SLEEPING_* are excluded based on STATE_SLEEPING)
This hack correct this issue by preventing dead creatures in LIST_FRONT and are disallowed use of LIST_MIDDLE from being targetted

-----1200 Ability-specific Use Item Animations [M]
Allows the use of different custom animation sequences for different abilities of the same item
This is reflected by the support of extra columns in ITEMANIM.2DA

ITEMANIM.2DA
Description
This file lists the character animation sequence to be played when an item ability is used. This only applies to items that are used in UseItem() and UseItemPoint() actions, or equivalent thereof (i.e. used as quick item).

[ROWNAME]: Item ResRef
SEQUENCE: The animation sequence to play for the first ability of the specified item (from seq.ids). If there are no other columns, this is the animation sequence to play for all abilities.
<subsequent columns>: The animation sequence to play for the (n+1)th ability of the specified item (from seq.ids), where n is the name of the column.

Example
WAND05.ITM has two abilities

2DA V1.0
-1
	SEQUENCE	1               
WAND05	-1	12

Using the first ability plays no animation sequence (-1). Using the second ability plays animation sequence 12 (SEQ_ATTACK_BACKSLASH).

For a ranged attack that hits, both launcher and ammo abilities are checked for bit 25 and backstabbing toggled if at least one of the two has bit 25 set

Examples:
		Usable by thief		Ranged		Bit 25 Off	Bit 25 On
Dagger		Yes			No		Backstab	No backstab
Warhammer	No			No		No backstab	Backstab
Arrow		Yes			Yes		No backstab	Backstab (bit 25 can be set either on Arrow or Bow)
Throwing Axe	No			Yes		No backstab	Backstab

-----150 Configurable Critical Hit Aversion [M]
Adds new item flag bit 25 'Toggle critical hit aversion'
If an item with bit 25 set is equipped, critical hit aversion is enabled if the item is equipped in a non-helmet slot
If an item with bit 25 set is equipped, critical hit aversion is disabled if the item is equipped in a helmet slot

Modding Note
Whenever a critical hit is averted by helmet or not with this hack, string reference 20696 will display, reading 'Critical Hit Averted By Helmet'. Mods using this hack should change the string reference to read 'Critical Hit Averted'

-----1040 Configurable Items Cannot Target Invisible [M]
Adds new item ability flag bit 26 'Cannot target invisible'
This includes all creatures with invisibility and/or sanctuary

Modding Note
If this hack is enabled and a player attempts to use an item ability on an invisible/sanctuary creature with bit 26 set, string reference 46529 will display.
It reads 'Spell Cancelled: Can not target spells on invisible or sanctuaried creatures.'
This is not consistent with this hack.
Mods using this hack should change the string reference to read 'Action Cancelled: Can not target action on invisible or sanctuaried creatures.'
This substitutes the words 'Spell[s]' with 'Action' and allows compatibility with the 'Configurable Spells Can Target Invisible' hack.

-----740 Externalise Item-Creature Exclusions [M, X]
Externalises creature-specific item restrictions to ITEM_USE.2DA.

ITEM_USE.2DA
Description
[ROWNAME]: the resource name of the item that the item-creature restrictions apply to
USER: death variable/script name of creature (not case-sensitive)
STRREF#: the string reference to display in the inventory screen when the restriction indicated by the flag value of # applies
FLAG: bitfield indicating the type/s of restriction to apply

FLAG bits
bit 0 [1]: the item cannot be picked up from any slot of the creature (this overrides bits 3 and 4)
bit 1 [2]: the item can only be equipped by the creature (this is 'stackable', so multiple item entries with different creatures mean that each of the listed creatures can equip the item)
bit 2 [4]: no restrictions (this bit is reserved for GemRB)
bit 3 [8]: the item cannot be picked up from any equipped slot of the creature
bit 4 [16]: the item cannot be picked up from any inventory slot of the creature
bit 5 [32]: the item cannot be dropped into any equipped slot of the creature
bit 6 [64]: the item cannot be dropped into any inventory slot of the creature

For example,
	USER	STRREF	FLAG	STRREF2	STRREF4	STRREF8	STRREF16	STRREF32	STRREF64
MISC84	MINSC	10218	3	10218	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

Item MISC84 cannot be picked up from any slot of "Minsc", and can only be equipped by "Minsc".

-----910 Non-Ammo Launcher Damage Fix [F]
Fixes a bug with launcher weapons granting the damage and strength bonuses of non-launcher (4)-type abilities
This corrects the issue with non-ammo-requiring launcher weapons (using ranged (2) ability) granting extra damage when ammo is equipped
If this is enabled, damage bonuses of launcher abilities are only given for the first launcher (4)-type ability of the launcher weapon

-----800 Use Animation Percentages for Throwing Weapons [M, T]
Enables the use of item ability slash %, backslash %, and jab % fields for ranged weapons equipped in a weapon slot that do not require a launcher
Because this hack makes the creature use of the SEQ_ATTACK_[] animations instead of SEQ_SHOOT, attacks play the SEQ_ATTACK and SEQ_ATTACK_[] animation sounds instead of the SEQ_SHOOT animation sound
These percentages will only affect creatures with animation IDs in the 0x5000-0x53FF group with animation prefix starting with C, and 0x6*** groups to maintain vanilla behaviour and Infinity Animations compatibility

-----370 Externalise Animation Walking Sounds [M, X]
Externalises all animation walking sounds to ANIWKSND.2DA

ANIWKSND.2DA
Description
[ROWNAME]: animation ID
ANIMATION: the name of the animation for your reference (from ANIMATE.IDS)
WALK_SOUND: 6-character string specifying the root name of the walking sound.
Longer strings are read truncated. Shorter strings cause havoc!
A value of '*' is equivalent to no walking sound.
WALK_NUM: integer specifying the number of walking sounds available for the root name.

As per engine behaviour, a sound file will be loaded with name <WALK_SOUND><random>,
where <random> is mapped 0 -> a, 1 -> b, 2 -> c, ..., (WALK_NUM - 1) -> nul
For example,

	WALK_SOUND	WALK_NUM
0x1234	WAL_20		4

Walking sound for animation ID 0x1234 loads one of the following sounds:
WAL_20a [0]
WAL_20b [1]
WAL_20c [2]
WAL_20  [3]

If WALK_SOUND is set to 'TERRAIN' and WALK_NUM is set to '*', ANITNSND.2DA is used
to determine the walking sound.

ANITNSND.2DA
Description
[ROWNAME]: terrain code, based on search map pixel
WALK_SOUND: as ANIWKSND.2DA above
WALK_NUM: as per ANIWKSND.2DA above

-----680 Soundset Subtitles [M, X]
Enables subtitles for custom soundsets
This works by appending CSOUND.2DA
This is vanilla-compatible: if no column is present in CSOUND.2DA, no subtitles are used
Before disabling this hack from your game, please switch the characters' soundsets back to Default

Modding Note
To use this hack, use APPEND_COL on CSOUND.2DA. The column header should contain the prefix of the soundset (e.g. FEMALE1). The values for each sound should point to the string reference to display for the sound with suffix designated by the existing LETTER column.

Please note the LETTER values in rows labelled with the numbers 30, 31, 39, 63, and 64 are incorrect in vanilla Throne of Bhaal and should be corrected as shown below:

COPY_EXISTING "csound.2da" "override/csound.2da"
  COUNT_2DA_COLS nColumns
  PATCH_IF nColumns == 2 THEN BEGIN
    SET_2DA_ENTRY 31 1 2 "x"

-----180 Casting Fixes [F]
Fixes a number of issues with casting sounds and graphics:
1. Modifies the way that the gender of casting sound selection is handled
Normally, female gender uses female sound, other and niether gender uses unvoiced sound, and all other genders uses male sound
This caused problems with spells like Project Image where illusory female creatures used male casting sounds
This hack modifies so that female gender uses female sound, other and niether gender uses unvoiced sound, male gender uses male sound, and all other genders check the Sex field (0x237) in the CRE file format. If the Sex field is male, male sound is used. If female, female sound is used. For any other Sex field, an unvoiced sound is used

2. Takes into account the MENTALSPEED stat when determining whether to play a casting sound at all, whether to play a gendered or unvoiced casting sound, and whether to play the casting animation

-----1010 Configurable Spells Can Be Unvoiced [M]
Adds new bit 25 to spell flags 'Can Be Cast When Silenced'
When a spell is being cast while silenced using this flag, the silenced casting sound "CHA_S*" is used
This does not change the behaviour of Vocalize (SPWI219), Set Snare (SPCL412), Set Special Snare (SPCL414), and Pocket Plane (SPIN649), which are castable when silenced without the hack

-----880 Configurable Spells Can Target Invisible [M]

Modding Note
If this hack is enabled and a player attempts to use an item ability on an invisible/sanctuary creature with bit 26 set, string reference 46529 will display.
It reads 'Spell Cancelled: Can not target spells on invisible or sanctuaried creatures.'
This is not consistent with this hack.
Mods using this hack should change the string reference to read 'Action Cancelled: Can not target action on invisible or sanctuaried creatures.'
This substitutes the words 'Spell[s]' with 'Action' and allows compatibility with the 'Configurable Items Cannot Target Invisible' hack.

-----1000 Expanded Triggers [M]
Enables the use of new triggers

Descriptions
0x4100 NextTriggerObject(O:Object*)
Defines the object that the next trigger will be evaluated in reference to
The trigger itself does not evaluate and does not count as a trigger in an OR() block
If the object cannot be found, the next trigger will evaluate to false

Allows the contingency panel to support spells containing the Select Spell opcode
Instead of showing the parent spell, the child spells contained in the 2DA file specified by the 'Resource' field of the Select Spell opcode that would be used if the spell is cast at the creature's level are shown
Child spells are displayed separately, and are thus not stacked upon, normal spells or child spells from a different parent spell (for example, A.SPL with a Select Spell opcode of A.2DA containing SPWI112 would display separately from SPWI112.SPL and separately from B.SPL with a Select Spell opcode of B.2DA containing SPWI112)
