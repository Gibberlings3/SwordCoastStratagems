// general AI
@101="Enemies have fairly minimal intelligence, and show little discrimination in how they use their attacks and abilities. Human and demihuman enemies do not use their class abilities and magical items. Groups of creatures will attack together, but will not call for help from other groups."
@102="Enemies become somewhat smarter, avoiding dangerous regions and choosing their targets intelligently; they still do not use items and class abilities. Thieves will attempt to hide if out of sight of the party."
@103="Enemies use potions and class abilities if they have them; in particular, thieves will use invisibility potions, if they have them, to get out of sight in combat. Enemies often choose to begin combat at a distance rather than walking up to you for a chat. Intelligent opponents will sometimes call for help from nearby groups. Selected high-level thieves and fighters use High-Level Abilities."
@104="All eligible thieves and fighters use High-Level Abilities."

@111="Mages have fairly limited intelligence; they will renew their defenses periodically and to some extent avoid really unwise uses of their magic, but no more. They use only defensive sequencers and contingencies."
@112="Mages use their spells intelligently, choosing the most appropriate targets and paying careful attention to their own magical defenses. They will mostly refrain from using offensive sequencers and contingencies."

@122="Mages advance-cast a small number of spells with a duration of at least several hours (like Stoneskin)."
@123="Mages advance-cast any defensive spells with a duration of at least one turn per level.

@222="The guardians use their supernatural powers, but quite infrequently."
@223="The guardians use their supernatural powers more frequently."
@224="The guardians use their powers almost constantly. The Demon Knight's mirror generates copies of the party, not generic Mirror Fiends, and the Demon Knight itself is significantly enhanced."

// Beholders

@231="Beholders use mostly their less-lethal eyestalks (Charm, Fear, Domination, Paralysis, Cause wounds, Slow) and do not use their magic-suppressing central eye. Hive Mothers use only their weaker magic."
@232="Beholders also use their central eye against mages and party defenses. Hive Mothers use their full range of spells."

@242="Illithids use Maze and telekinetic attacks; their general targetting intelligence improves."
