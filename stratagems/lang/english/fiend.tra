@40001 = ~This vile text contains forbidden secrets of the fiends of the Lower Planes, including the true names of several powerful fiends. Through detailed study of the grimoire, a mage can learn how to exercise a modicum of control over some summoned fiends. When using the mage spells Summon Fiend and Cacofiend to bring forth a fiend, the character will bind the fiend called forth to obey <PRO_HISHER> will, instead of simply leaving it to rampage at random.
Most wizards avoid demon binding for good reason: <PRO_HESHE> who trafficks with fiends puts <PRO_HISHER> immortal soul at risk. Each time the character summons and binds a fiend, there is a 10% chance that <PRO_HISHER> alignment will shift one step towards evil. If <PRO_HESHE> is already evil, there is instead a 10% chance that <PRO_HISHER> soul will be forfeit to the denizens of the lower planes. A character whose soul is lost in this way cannot be resurrected from the dead - once slain, <PRO_HESHE> is forever lost.
