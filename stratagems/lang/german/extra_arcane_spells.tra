Area of Effect: Enemies within 30ft
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell, the wizard directs a powerful blast of electricity towards all foes within 30 feet.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a bolt of energy that inflicts 3d6 points of electrical damage to a single creature. The damage increases by 1d6 for every two caster levels above 3rd level, to a maximum of 8d6 at 13th level. A successful Save vs. Spell reduces this damage to half.

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster calls up a small Earth Elemental and merges <PRO_HISHER> form with it, gaining a portion of its strength and resilience. As long as the spell is in effect, the caster receives a +2 bonus to Armor Class. The elemental energies can be discharged at any time in a powerful punch, directed at any creature adjacent to the caster. The punch automatically hits and does 1d6 points of crushing damage per two levels (to a maximum of 5d6 at 10th level), and the target must make a save vs. spell or be stunned for 1 round. Discharging the spell in this way ends it. The punch does not count as a magical weapon."

By means of this spell, the caster can telekinetically hurl all hostile creatures within a small region directly away from <PRO_HIMHER>self at high speed, inflicting 3d8 points of crushing damage and knocking the creatures unconscious for a few seconds, unless they save vs. spells at a -2 penalty. The spell is ineffective against any creature of ogre size or larger, and - due to the interaction of the telekinetic field with surrounding solid matter - cannot be used to propel creatures off cliffs or into impassable terrain."
