anim (directory): any animation INI file here will cause iwdspells to fetch the required BAM and WAV files for that INI

anim_maps: IWD CRE files with the LHS animation get mapped over to the RHS animation

bam_copy_[arcane/divine]: spell/scroll BAM images from IWD that replace the BG2 versions

BG2EE_SPELL.IDS: what it sounds like, verbatim copy of BG2EE's spell.ids file

do_not_copy: items on this list don't get copied over (and nor do any resources that depend on them, unless they depend on something else too)

ds_iwd: minimal ds data to give BGEE-level detectability to the new spells

file_renames: these files, when copied over, get renamed to the RHS entry, and any references to them are updates

force_iterate_start: if you install the spell on the LHS, the system starts by collecting resources fromt he file on the RHS, not from the spell.

green_spells_[arcane/divine]: list of spells (basically summoning) that need a green icon but don't have one available in IWD. They get algorithmically recoloured.

ids_remaps: small changes in the IWD ids entry, so as to avoid namespace awkwardness in BG2

iwd_[arcane/divine/bard]: The spells to install, plus the BG2 scroll to use as a shadow if installing a wizard spell

overwrite: these spells should overwrite the BG2 equivalent (normally, if there's a BG2 version there already, we skip our version)

resource_overwrite: these items should be copied over even if they have a namespace conflict with BG(2)EE resources
