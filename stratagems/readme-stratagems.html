  <p>Sword Coast Stratagems (<acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate">SCS

      around improving monster <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> and
      encounter difficulties, but also including a number of cosmetic and ease-of-use 
      components and tweaks to abilities and spells.</p>

<h2><a name="install" id="install">Installation</a></h2>
<div class="section">
<p>If you have installed version 21 or earlier of SCS or SCSII, <b>you must
completely uninstall (and preferably delete) it before installing this version.</b> (It should be installable over the top of version 22 or later without incident.)</p>
<h3>Installing the mod</h3>
<p>Installation is fairly straightforward. Run "stratagems.exe" and tell it to
    install in your BG:EE folder, BG2:EE folder, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder, BG1TUTU folder, EasyTUTU folder, or Baldur's Gate Trilogy folder, as appropriate. (If nothing happens, run "stratagems.bat", in this folder.)
    </p>
    <p>
    (Finding this folder for the Enhanced Edition can be a bit tricky; it's the folder with "CHITIN.KEY" in it. On my install, the path to BG:EE is C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00766, and the path
    to BGII:EE is C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00786.</p>
  <h3>Choosing components</h3>
  <p> Components for SCS are organised into groups. For each group, the installer will offer you the choice of installing all, some or none. If you pick "all", the installer will still ask you about some components, as some SCS components have various different options.</p>
  <p>Once you have selected all of your components, the mod will install. <b>This takes a while</b> --- about 15 minutes on a fairly fast desktop for a BGT install. This is why the installer for SCS is slightly different from the installer used for most Infinity Engine mods: it lets you choose all your options in advance, rather than having to wait for each component to be installed before selecting the next one.</p>
  <p>If you want to change your install later, run stratagems.bat again. It will offer you the choice of uninstalling the entire mod, rebuilding the install from scratch, or fine-tuning the install component-by-component.</p>
  <p>(For advanced users: under the hood, all this is just WEIDU. You can bypass the auto-installer and go straight to the standard process in the usual way - just rename weidu.exe to setup-stratagems.exe and run it. On BG:EE, though, this needs to be done at the command line with --script-style bg2 added.)

<h3>Installing on non-Windows systems</h3>
<p>I don't generally test on non-Windows systems, so I can't vouch for any of this.</li>
<p>On Mac OSX, follow the above instructions, except that you should click on setup-SCS.command, and then drop the ".exe" suffixes.
<p>On Linux, usual instructions apply: Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract
(at least) the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal,
cd to your BG2 installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries. Finally, run WeInstall SCS to install the mod.<p>
<h3>A note on ToBEx</h3>
<p>SCS ships with ToBEx version 21 for use on non-Enhanced Edition installs. If you want to use a more recent version, install it wherever you like - before SCS or after. Either way, things should work fine. (If you don't know what ToBEx means, ignore this note.)</p>
</div>



<h2><a name="compat" id="compat">Compatibility</a></h2>
<div class="section"> 
<p>This game discusses the base game, then mods in general, and then goes through specific mods in alphabetical order.</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate">SCS</acronym> is
    designed to work with any of the following install options:
    <ul>
    <li>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition
    <li>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition
    <li>The original (or GoG) Baldur's Gate II, with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion installed
    <li>The "Baldur's Gate Tutu" conversion of Baldur's Gate I to the Baldur's Gate II engine, with both the Tales of the Sword Coast (TotSC) expansion to BG1 and the Throne of Bhaal expansion to BG2 installed
    <li>Macready's "EasyTUTU" version of Baldur's Gate Tutu", again with both TotSC and ToB installed
    <li>The Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) combination of BG1, TotSC, BG2 and ToB into one game
    </ul>
    SCS does not work with the original Baldur's Gate, or with versions of Baldur's Gate II that do not include Throne of Bhaal. It requires the offical patch (26498) for Baldur's Gate II to be installed if you are not using the Enhanced Edition. (<b>Do not</b> install the "beta" official patch 26499, which is bugged.)
    <h3>Mods in general</h3>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> attempts
    to be as compatibility-friendly as possible. It should be compatible with
    most quest, item, <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> and
    tweak mods (I don't know of any significant incompatibilities with currently-used mods other than those listed below).
        <p> In general, when installing multiple mods, it matters which order you install them in. A rough guide is:
    <ol>
    <li>The Ascension mod
    <li>The BG2 Fixpack
    <li>Mods which change the spell or item systems
    <li>Mods which add new quests and similar game content
    <li>Mods which add new joinable characters
    <li>Mods which tweak aspects of gameplay
    </ol>
    Within each category, as a rule of thumb you should install older mods first.
    <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> is a tweak mod, so it should be installed towards the end
    of your installation. Ideally, <acronym title="Sword Coast">SCS
        </acronym> prefers to be installed last, but several other recent mods (aTweaks, BiggTweaks, BG2 Tweakpack)
        also say "install last" in their readmes. You can <b>generally</b> install any of these listed mods after <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> fairly safely. (In particular, aTweaks is designed with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> specifically in mind, and should definitely be installed after <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>). Other mods, and in particular any mods that add new items, really need to be installed before SCS.




  <h3>Ascension</h3>
  <p>Ascension is fully compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
      II</acronym>. By default, Ascension enemies use their own scripts instead
      of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> scripts,
      although a number of components change this. (Note in particular that the Ascension "tougher Demogorgon" component is overridden by the "Improved Fiends" component of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.</p>
  <p>However, a number of reports suggest that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>  is not compatible with "BP-Ascension", the version of Ascension that ships with the Big Picture.
  I recommend that you use the standard WEIDU version of Ascension (at <a href="www.weidu.org">www.weidu.org</a>) with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.
  (Users constructing a Big World Project mega-install should probably take advice from <a href="www.shsforums.net">www.shsforums.net</a> on the best strategy.) </p>
  <p>Incidentally, Ascension is about the only mod that should be installed <b>before</b> the BG2 fixpack.</p>

    <h3>aTweaks</h3>
  <p>aTweaks is designed to function with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>. It should be installed <em>after</em> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>. (This is an exception to the usual rule that SCS should be installed last.)</p>
  <h3>Big Picture</h3>
  <p>I believe that the latest version of Big Picture aims at some level of SCS compatibility. I haven't been able to investigate myself. On balance I'm inclined to think that for a stable install you should choose one or the other, as both try to do broadly similar things in rather different ways.</p>

        <h3>BG2 Fixpack</h3>
  <p><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> is designed to work with the (<acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>) <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack</strong> when used on BG2 and BGT installs. On old-style BG2, and BGT, I
        very strongly recommend that you install this fixpack first, before any
        other mods (except Ascension, if you use it) but certainly before <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>. It probably installs without the Fixpack
        but it's designed on the assumption that Fixpack is installed, and odd
        things may happen if it isn't. The Fixpack is not required (or available) on Tutu or Enhanced Edition installs</p>


<h3>Divine Remix</h3>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> has
    slight compatibility issues with Divine Remix. Divine Remix rearranges the
    spellbooks of some potentially-hostile priests and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems ">SCS</acronym>, not knowing this, will fail to use their spells effectively.
    This is unlikely to have any significant effect on play, though.</p>

          <h3>G3 Tweakpack</h3>
      <p>The Gibberlings 3 Tweakpack can be installed before or after SCS; both should work. It probably makes sense to put last whichever one you think you're more likely to modify in play. For most people I probably recommend putting Tweakpack last. (Also, it takes much less time than SCS to uninstall and reinstall.)


    <h3>Item Revisions</h3>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> should be compatible with Demivrgvs's and Mike1072's "Item Revisions (IR) mod. IR should be installed <b>before</b><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> (and indeed before most mods).
  Some IR components overlap  with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> components; these components will be silently skipped on an install of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.

    <h3>Oversight</h3>
  <p> If you install "Tougher Sendai" from Oversight then <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems ">SCS</acronym>
    will still work, but the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> improvements to Sendai
    (in the Smarter Mages / Smarter Priests component) will be skipped in favour of the Oversight ones. Pick which one you want.


  <h3>Quest Pack</h3>
  <p>Quest Pack's <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> and creature
    enhancements should be compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym>. Install Quest Pack first, then install whichever components
    of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> you
    want: they will override the Quest Pack for the affected creatures. Quest
    Pack still has some content not influenced by <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym>: notably, it improves Mummies and Umber Hulks.</p>


      <h3>Refinements</h3>
      <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS </acronym> is fully compatible with the "Refinements" mod, and in particular, will make use of the modified High-Level Abilities introduced by Refinements. Refinements must be installed before SCS for this to work properly. (Yes, I know the Refinements readme says "install me last"; trust me on this.)</p>



    <h3>Spell Revisions</h3>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> should be compatible with Demivrgvs's "Spell Revisions" (SR) mod, and I make a reasonable (though imperfect) amount of effor to allow for SR changes. SR should be installed <b>before</b><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> (and indeed before most mods).
  Some SR components overlap  with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> components; these components will be silently skipped on an install of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.


  <h3>Tactics</h3>
  <p>Compatibility between Tactics and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
      </acronym> depends on the components:</p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Components which have a direct <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> analogue: common sense applies, only install the ones you
        want. These are: Improved Bodhi, Improved Golems, Improved Irenicus in Hell, Improved D'Arnise Keep, Improved Kangaxx,
        Improved Mind Flayers, Smarter Dragons, Smarter Beholders, Slightly Smarter
        Mages and Liches, Slightly Tougher Demons,
        Streamlined Trolls (which overlaps with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>'s "Resilient Trolls"), Tougher Druid Grove (the Faldorn part ovelaps with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>'s) Improved Faldorn, Improved Sahuagin City, and Improved Demon Knights (which
        overlaps with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>'s Improved Fiends component).</li>
    <li>Components with no overlap with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>: should be compatible. These are: Improved Ilyich, the Ritual,
         Kuroisan, Red Badge, Lich in the Docks, Fighter/Illusionist
        in the Docks, Improved Crypt King, Improved Nymphs,
         and the kits. Install these <strong>before</strong> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.</li>
    <li>The "Improved Maevar" component is incompatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>'s "Smarter Arcane Spellcasters". Only install one of them.</li>
    <li>The "Always Toughest Random Spawns" component is basically the same as the toughest setting of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>'s "Increase difficulty of level-dependent monster groupings" component. I recommend that you use the latter, as it has the same overall effect but is coded in a way that
        will cause fewer problems for <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> and other mods. (The Tactics version is known to cause some (harmless) warnings when installed with some components of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>.)
    <li>Improved Undead is basically not compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>. If you want to try it anyway, it will need to be installed <strong>after</strong> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> (it's the only component of Tactics for which this is true).</li>
    <li>Tougher Druid Grove is probably incompatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>'s "Smarter Divine Spellcasters". Try at own risk.</li>
    <li> Tougher Fire Giants appears to be compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>'s "Improved Fire Giant Temple". Install the Tactics version first, and you should find that fire giants get both the Tactics and the
	<acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> upgrades.</li>
  </ul> 

      <h3>Wheels of Prophecy</h3>

  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS </acronym> is
fully compatible with my Throne of Bhaal content-enhancement mod, Wheels of Prophecy. Install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> after Wheels of Prophecy.
   </div>

<h2><a name="over" id="over">Overview</a></h2>
<div class="section"> 
  <p>Sword Coast Stratagems is a collection of mini-mods for the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate I and II, the original edition of Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, Baldur's Gate TUTU, and Baldur's Gate Trilogy. Although it contains many tweaks and ease-of-use components, it is mostly a tactics mod, intended to make the combats in the
    game more challenging and interesting. A full install basically rewrites the entire AI system of the game.</p>
  <p> Since there are a lot of tactics mods out there, of very different styles,
    it's probably simplest to describe the distinctive features of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>. (I don't want to suggest that all of these are automatically
    advantages: there are lots of different styles of play, and different mods
    fit different people.) Some more thoughts of mine on how to assess tactical
    mods can be found <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=11484&amp;hl=">here</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> plays fair.</strong> I've made a fairly sustained effort
          to ensure that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> opponents fight by the rules and don't use powers denied
          to the player (other than obvious things like dragons' breath weapons,
          liches' ability to see through invisibility, etc!) This is probably
          most notable for spellcasters - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> mages don't randomly get uninterruptible spells, improved
          casting time, free Alacrity, or the like. (In fact, I've removed these
          powers from creatures in the vanilla game occasionally, though I haven't
          done so systematically.) However, "fair" is sometimes in the eye of the beholder, and there are also one or two exceptions (notably fiend-summoning by mages and priests), so please do read the component descriptions if this is important to you!</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> is almost pure <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>.</strong> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> mucks around rather little with the core powers of creatures,
          and hardly at all with their abilities, resistances, saving throws
          and the like. Its main focus is on getting creatures to do as much
          as they possibly can with their existing abilities. In particular,
          its targeting is very careful - hopefully you'll almost never see a
          mage do something stupid like cast repeated spells at someone immune
          to that spell.</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> is quite low-key in its changes</strong> Where <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> does modify something other than <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>,
          it usually does so in a relatively undramatic manner - adding a few
          more creatures, giving a creature a couple of other magic powers in
          keeping with powers it's already used, and so forth. It doesn't give
          new ultra-powerful spells to creatures who didn't have any magic before,
          or give creatures massive damage resistances, for instance. (Again,
          there's not necessarily anything wrong with doing this, it's just not
          what <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> is about).</li>
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> is very customisable.</strong> Feel free to install whichever
          combination of components you like - there is a separate one for each
          major <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> / tactical
          change.</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> is systematic.</strong> I've tried to be very thorough
          in making sure that there aren't "gaps" in its <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> modifications
          - so that all hostile wizards, for instance, and not just some, are
          upgraded.</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> tries to be as compatible as possible.</strong> I've done
          the best I can to ensure that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> will install on top of other mods (especially non-tactical
          ones) without causing problems for either. In particular, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
          </acronym> dynamically alters its scripts to take (some) account
          of new magic items introduced by other mods.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, playing <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
      </acronym> shouldn't exactly feel like a whole new game - it should feel
      like the old game, but with your foes acting much more intelligently and
      realistically.</p>
  <p>At present, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> makes
    no use of the difficulty slider except in the "Beholder's lair" upgrade (which is borrowed from Quest Pack) and in one choice of options for the Mage and Priest components. I hope to introduce difficulty-slider dependence in a future update.</p>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> also
    contains a number of other small tweaks to the game. Most of these (especially
    the spell and item modifications) are intended to modify the game in small
    ways that are helpful from the point of view of tactical challenge - some
    make the game a little easier, others make it a little harder. I recommend
    that all the spell tweaks are installed since the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts
    assume that they are present, but it isn't compulsory.</p>
    <p>On BGT, TUTU and BG:EE versions, SCS also includes a collection of components that improve <acronym
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-related aspects of game-play in small
    ways - for instance, it implements the useful <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> feature where you can send <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to inns when you don't need them;
    it lets you break up <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> pairs
    like Khalid/Jaheira without having to arrange for one of them to get killed;
    it lets you choose <acronym title="Non-Player Character's">NPC's</acronym> weapon
    proficiencies rather than being stuck with the game's preset choices; and
    it allows Yeslick, the dwarven fighter-cleric, to use axes.</p> 
    </p>

  <p> Finally, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
      </acronym> contains a few ease-of-use features (notably, an ease-of-use
      player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script with
      a large number of convenience features) and a few "flavour" features that
      don't really affect gameplay but hopefully aid the feeling of immersion
      in the game world. </p> 
</div> 
<h2><a name="content" id="content">Contents</a></h2> 
<div class="section"> 
<p>Unless otherwise noted, all components are for all forms of the game.</p>
  <h3><a name="core" id="core" >Core Component: Initialise</a></h3>
  <p><strong>(Almost all components require this)</strong></p>
  This component does various setup tasks needed by most other components in SCS. You won't directly notice what it does, but it fixes a few bugs and extends the game's capabilities to allow
  the rest of SCS to function correctly. (For experts: among other tasks, it installs Detectable Spells and (on non-BGEE Windows installs) ToBEx, makes magic items detectable, modifies weapons so that the script engine can detect their enchantment level,
  fixes the bugged Spell Shield spell, reconfigures area-effect spells so that Mirror Image doesn't block them, and prevents casting from being disrupted by zero-damage attacks.)
  <p>(Advanced users who find my mods slightly too good at detecting items may
  wish to experiment with setting AI_Does_Not_Detect_Items to 1 in stratagems/stratagems.ini; this isn't recommended, though.)</p>
        <h3><a name="spelltweaks" id="spelltweaks">Spell Tweaks</a></h3>
  <p> These components make rather minor alterations to the spells in the game,
    usually in the interest of game balance or consistency. All changes are fully
    documented in the spell descriptions themselves. Note that while all these
    components are optional, many of the tactical choices made by wizards and
    priests in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    </acronym> assume that they are installed, so you may notice some slight
    anomalies in enemy behaviour if you don't install them all. </p>
  
    <p><strong>Standardise spells between <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> (TUTU, BGT)</strong></p>
    <p>At the moment, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>
    are both a bit inconsistent in their use of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>-only spells (like Stoneskin or Holy
    Smite). Non-player characters don't have any of these spells, and enemies
    don't use them, but party sorcerors, clerics and druids have access to them,
    and party mages can choose them at first level.</p>
  <p>This component offers two alternative ways to resolve the inconsistency. The first (available only 
  for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> players) blocks player access to all
    <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>-only spells except for Find Familiar and the various wild-magic spells.</p>
    <p>The second alternative reintroduces into <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> all of the
    new wizard spells of fifth level or lower. Some are added to stores, others to treasure caches; see <a href="#scrolls">here</a> for
    all of the locations. </p>
    <p>Note that this is not needed for BG:EE because the BG2 spells are already available. (In fact, the code to make them available is based on SCS code, so in effect this component is already included in BG:EE.)</p>


 <p><strong>Make Protection from Normal Missiles affect some magical projectiles</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the power of the Protection from Normal Missiles (PNM) spell. It now blocks most magical
  arrows, bolts etc that lack a formal "plus": that is, it blocks fire arrows, ice arrows and the like. The exceptions are the Arrows of Detonation, the Arrows
    of Slaying, and the Arrows of Dispelling. Combined with the component that replaces +1 weapons with nonmagical weapons, this significantly increases the usefulness of PNM (read: makes PNM not entirely useless for NPC mages). </p>


  <p><strong>Allow Spellstrike to take down a Protection from Magic scroll (BG2,BGEE,BGT)</strong></p>
  In the original game, the protective sphere produced by a Protection from Magic
  scroll is completely impenetrable by any spell at all - if you use one, all
  a hostile wizard can do is run away or fight in melee. This component allows
  the most powerful mage anti-magic spell, the 9th level spell Spellstrike, to
  destroy the anti-magic sphere of one of these scrolls. It also allows the anti-magic
  ray of the Hive Mother beholder to destroy the sphere.
  <p><strong>More consistent Breach spell (always affects liches and rakshasas;
      doesn't penetrate Spell Turning)</strong></p>
  <p>Although it isn't documented, the 5th level spell Breach will remove a creature's
    combat protections (such as Stoneskin) even if that creature is protected
    by Spell Deflection, Spell Turning or Spell Trap; it will not, however, affect
    creatures like liches or rakshasas, because they are immune to spells of
    level 5 or below. This component removes both features: Breach now bounces
    off Spell Turning (etc.), but it affects even those creatures immune to "normal" 5th
    level spells.</p> 
  <p> Once this component is installed, the Breach effect of the Wand of Spell
    Striking will behave in exactly the same way as the Breach spell. </p> 
  <p> Enemy wizards will assume Breach works this way (and so won't target characters
    protected by Spell Turning etc with a Breach), even if you don't install
    this component. </p> 
  <p><strong>Antimagic attacks penetrate improved invisibility</strong></p> 
  <p>This component changes those spells which target a creature's spell defences
    (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Secret Word, Spellstrike,
    Ruby Ray of Reversal - but not Breach) so as to allow them to target creatures which are protected by Improved Invisibility.
    The idea of this component is that these spells can now be cast on enemy
    mages who are protected by Improved Invisibility - this makes the Improved
    Invisibility / Spell Immunity: Divination combination less overpowering.</p> 
  <p> Prior to version 16, this component worked by giving the spells a small area of effect. This option remains, as a legacy component, for those who prefer it.</p>
  <p> The antimagic attacks of enemy mages will bypass Improved Invisibility
    even if you don't install this component.</p>
  <p><strong>Iron Skins behaves like Stoneskin (can be brought down by Breach)</strong></p> 
  <p>For some reason the Iron Skins spell, although it appears identical to a
    Stoneskin, counts as a Spell Protection (like Spell Turning) and not as a
    Combat Protection (like Stoneskin). This means that in the unmodded game,
    Breach does not bring down Iron Skins, but (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>)
    Secret Word does. This component relabels Iron Skins as a Combat Protection.</p> 
  <p> Enemy mages will assume that Iron Skins works this way (and so will, <acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>,
    cast Breach at it) even if you don't install this component.</p> 
  <p><strong>Modify the Harm spell so it does damage rather than reducing target
      to 1 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp (BG2,BGT)</acronym></strong></p>
  <p>The Harm spell reduces its target to 1 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> in
    2nd edition <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>; in 3rd
    edition, it does a large amount of damage instead. This component modifies
    Harm to work more like the 3rd edition spell: it inflicts 150 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage,
    with no saving throw, on a successful touch attack. The rationale for this
    is that Harm (especially combined with Critical Strike) is otherwise an almost-instant
    way of eliminating even foes with hundreds of hit points. Harm remains lethal
    in this component, but is not quite so overwhelming.</p> 
  <p> There are two versions of this component. One version modifies only the
    player's version of Harm; the other modifies player and enemy versions alike.
    (The former component is probably more merciful, as rather few characters
    in the party will have more than 150 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> even
    at full strength, at least until very late in the game.)</p>
  <p><strong>Make individual versions of Spell Immunity available, so that players
      can use them in Contingencies etc. (BG2,BGEE,BGT)</strong></p>
      <p>This component is self explanatory. It should be irrelevant for the vast majority of old-BG2 users; I leave it in place for anyone who for some reason isn't using ToBEx.</p>

   <p><strong>Revert Greater Restoration back to only affecting one creature (BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Throne of Bhaal makes an undocumented (but widely known) modification to
    the Greater Restoration spell, making it into an area-effect spell that heals
    the entire party. This component reverts Greater Restoration to its <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> version (also its BGEE version),
    where only one creature can be affected.</p> 
  <p> Enemy priests assume Greater Restoration affects one target only (and so
    fairly rarely use it) even if you don't install this component.</p>
  <p><strong>Blade Barrier and Globe of Blades only affect hostile creatures (BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Even in the unmodded game, hostile priests used a special form of Blade
    Barrier that only affected their foes. (This is probably because, in the
    Infinity Engine, it is almost impossible to script creatures to avoid them
    crashing into each other.) This component (again in the name of fairness,
    and also of hassle avoidance) extends this to the player's version of these
    two spells: with it installed, players and <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    use the same form of Blade Barrier. (They don't quite use the old <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> version,
    which had a rather shorter range: they use a hybrid version, as large as
    the old <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> version but affecting
    only enemies).</p> 
  <p><strong>Cap damage done by Skull Trap at <acronym title="12 rolls of a six-sided die">12d6</acronym>(BGEE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Skull Trap, like the other <acronym title="Level 3">L3</acronym> spells
    Fireball and Lightning Bolt, does <acronym title="1 roll of a six-sided die">1d6</acronym> damage
    per level. Unlike those spells, though (and, I suspect, via an oversight
    on the developers' part, though I could be wrong) Skull Trap's damage is
    not capped at <acronym title="10 rolls of a six-sided die">10d6</acronym>,
    which makes it extremely lethal for a third level spell by the later part
    of the game. This component caps the damage of Skull Trap at <acronym title="12 rolls of a six-sided die">12d6</acronym> (the
    slightly higher cap reflects the much shorter range of Skull Trap compared
    to Fireball.</p> 
  <p>I don't know whether this component makes the game net easier or harder.
    I was led to write it after seeing a lich in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> playtesting cast a 3xSkull Trap Spell Sequencer, doing about
    100 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage even to characters who
    made all their saving throws.</p> 
  <p><strong>Make Power Word: Blind a single-target spell (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  Unlike other Power Words, Power Word: Blind has a small area of effect. This
  both makes it rather powerful, and makes it virtually impossible for enemy <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> to
  use without "friendly-fire" incidents. This component just makes Power Word:
  Blind target a single creature. (This is another component which the mage <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> will assume is installed.)
  <p><strong>Make Minute Meteors into +2 weapons (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p> In the unmodded game, the meteors created by the third-level Melf's Minute
    Meteors spell strike as +6 weapons, enough to penetrate any creature's resistances
    and to cut through even the Absolute Immunity spell. This strikes me as a
    bit overpowered for a third-level spell. This component makes meteors +2
    - still enough to hit most creatures, but not enough to cut through any of
    the protection-from-magic-weapon spells.</p> 
  <p><strong>Reduce the power of Inquisitors' Dispel Magic</strong></p> 
  <p> Inquisitors have a very fast powerful Dispel Magic ability, which is cast
    at twice their level. In most bits of the game, this is usually much higher
    than the majority of spellcasting enemies. This component reduces the power
    of the Dispel a little; you can choose to use it at 1.5xlevel or at 1xlevel.</p> 
<p><strong>Slightly reduce the power of Insect Plague spells (and the like) and let Fire Shields block them</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodified game, Insect Plague and Creeping Doom are very hard indeed for a spellcaster to deal with or defend against. This component
(which was partly inspired by Demivrgvs's Spell Revisions) grants a per-round saving throw against the spell-failure effects of the insects; it also
cause the insects to be destroyed if the target protects himself/herself with a Fire Shield spell (either colour) or Aura of Flaming Death spell.
<p><strong>Cosmetic change: stop Stoneskins from changing the caster's colour (BG2,TUTU,BGT)</strong></p>
The Stoneskin spell causes the recipient to turn a uniform grey colour, which is realistic but does get a bit monotonous when your spellcasters are permanently
protected by it. Note that this effects NPC mages too. This tweak (which uses Ascension64's "ToB Extender" and so is unavailable on BGEE) removes the colour change from the spell.
<p><strong>Slightly increase the power of Mantle, Improved Mantle, and Absolute Immunity (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodded game, Mantle protects you from +2 or weaker weapons, Improved Mantle from +3 or weaker weapons, and Absolute Immunity from +5 or weaker weapons. 
In all cases, arguably this is slightly too weak given the prevalence of such weapons in the game. This component increases each protective range by one: Mantle
protects against +3 or weaker weapons, Improved Mantle against +4 or weaker weapons, and Absolute Immunity against +6 or weaker weapons (i.e., basically everything.)
<p>The mage AI, in choosing its defensive spells, assumes that this component is installed; if you don't install it, mages may be slightly too willing to use Mantle etc
instead of Protection from Magic Weapons, though this shouldn't be too noticeable.</p>
<p><strong>Make spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them
to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency.</p>
<p>Note that if you have Smarter Mages installed, SCS enchanters will use sequencers and the like even if you do not have this component installed.</p>
<p><strong>Add extra spell scrolls for hard-to-find spells (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
<p>This component adds one extra copy of a few spells into shops in Amn and Trademeet. The spells are chosen to be ones which otherwise tend only to be found late in the game or only given good luck with random loot.
The affected spells are Bigby's Clenched Fist, Bigby's Crushing Hand, Control Undead, Improved Mantle, Invisibility 10' Radius, Mordenkainen's Sword, Pierce Shield, Remove Magic, 
Ruby Ray of Reversal, Spell Shield, Stone to Flesh, and Summon Nishruu. The location of the scrolls is determined randomly at install time.</p>
<p><strong>Give True Sight the ability to prevent magical blindness (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
<p>This spell modifies True Sight (and the clerical version, True Seeing) so that the caster is immune to Blindness while the spell is effective; existing Blindness effects
are also removed.</p>
<p>(The main reason for this change is that Blindness is essentially lethal for enemies (especially spellcasters). With this
change, Truesight effectively works like Vocalize, in addition to its other effects.)</p>
<p><strong>Prevent clones made by the Simulacrum and Project Image spells from using their magic items (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong> </p>
<p>At present, clones can use magic items belonging to their creator - even one-shot items - which arguably isn't what the spell is intended to do. This component blocks use of useable items, by greying out the quick-item bar for clones. Magic weapons, armour, and protective devices still function normally.</p>


  <h3><a name="itemtweaks" id="itemtweaks">Item Tweaks</a></h3>
  <p> These components remove, move or tone down the powers of a small number
    of magic items. It's not at all systematic (there are mods out there which
    go through almost all the items in the game and reduce their powers) but
    it reduces the extent to which a party can coast by on a few &uuml;ber-items.</p> 
    
      <p><strong>Make elemental arrows like <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> (TUTU,BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p>The arrows of Fire, Ice and Acid in <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> are seriously powerful in terms of damage
    done - much more so than their equivalents in <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, presumably because the designers chose
    to tone it down a bit. This component applies a similar tonedown to <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>.</p>
    <p><strong>Replace +1 arrows and other projectiles with Fine ones</strong></p>
   <p>
   This component replaces the weakest magical projectiles with non-magical ones of high quality. The main point is to make the "Protection from Normal Missiles" spell less ineffective when used by enemy spell-casters.
   </p>

  <p><strong>Replace many magic weapons with fine ones</strong></p>
  <p>This replaces most of the standard (i.e. non-named) +1 weapons in the game
    with non-magical equivalents: they still give you +1 to hit and damage but
    they don't give you +1 to initiative and they can't harm creatures that are
    immune to normal weapons.</p> 
  <p>This is mostly a cosmetic change: I wrote it because otherwise there are
    implausibly many magic weapons lying around the Sword Coast. It has two significant
    effects on the game, though. Firstly, +1 weapons cost a lot less (about a
    third as much). This mostly works against you (you generally find +1 weapons
    on enemies and sell them). More seriously, the iron plague affects "fine" weapons.
    I actually quite like this (feels more realistic, and makes the iron plague
    more a part of the game) but if it's just going to annoy you, don't use it:
    you can choose to have Fine weapons without the effects of the iron crisis.
    (It's clear from what you're told in-game that the crisis affects all iron
    (even iron not forged from Nashkel ore), but some people feel this is outweighed
    by the annoyance of having your high-quality weapons break so much. It's
    up to you.)</p>
    <p>My alpha version
    of this component (for BG2) changed +2 weapons too, but that turns out to have unwanted
    effects on game balance - +2 nonmagical weapons are great to use against
    mages with the Protection from Magic Weapons spell running, and the protagonist
    is probably immune to nonmagical weapons in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> and
    needs to be affectable by at least some opponents.</p>
    <p>This component applies to all versions of the game (though on BG2 installs there is no iron crisis, of course). For technical reasons there are actually two separate versions (one for BG2, one for TUTU/BGT/BGEE): the right one for your install should be selected automatically.</p>
      <p><strong>Reintroduce potions of extra-healing (TUTU,BGT,BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p>This places smallish numbers of potions of extra-healing at some of the
    temples (see <a href="#healing">here</a> for
    details) on the Sword Coast. It's mostly here because some of the enhanced encounters give potions
    of extra-healing to the bad guys, and it's rather unfair if the player can't
    buy them too.</p>
    <p><strong>Remove Arrows of Dispelling from stores</strong></p>
  <p>Arrows of Dispelling are arguably a little overpowered (they are all-but-eliminated in BG2, though some mods reintroduce them). This component gives you the choice of removing all, or all but five per store, of the Arrows of Dispelling from the stores throughout the game.</p>



  <p><strong>Remove the Shield of Balduran from the game (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p> I looked fairly extensively for ways of scripting beholders to deal with
    the Shield of Balduran without resorting to cheese, or for ways of toning
    down its powers while keeping it recognisable, but I had limited success. Ultimately,
    the character equipped with the Shield of Balduran is nearly invulnerable to beholders,
    pretty much irrespective of what strategy they use. This component (which,
    as always, is optional) removes the shield entirely from the game, leaving
    beholders as a challenge again.</p> 
    <p>(More recent versions of SCS have given beholders the power (after a few rounds) to steal
    the shield using their telekinesis power. It's possible that this means this component is
    not essential any more; I leave it in place anyway, since it's already written.)</p>
  <p><strong>Remove the invisibility power of the Staff of the Magi (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>The Staff of the Magi allows the wielder to go invisible, at will and without
    losing any time to do so, and this is famously overpowered. This component
    just removes the invisibility power from the Staff.</p> 
  <p><strong>Move Vhailor's Helm into Throne of Bhaal (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Vhailor's Helm is not absurdly powerful relative to some of the items that
    can be found later in the game, but it's a bit much for something that can
    be bought for cash at the start of chapter 2. This component moves it into
    the early part of the Throne of Bhaal expansion (see the spoilers for details).</p>
  <p><strong>Move the Cloak of Mirroring into Throne of Bhaal (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p> You can't get the Cloak until later in the game; still, it's hugely powerful and could be argued to be unbalancing at the time it's introduced. This component moves it into Throne of Bhaal (see the spoilers
    for details).</p> 
  <p><strong>Move the Robe of Vecna into Throne of Bhaal (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p> Similarly, the Robe of Vecna - one of the most powerful items in the game
    for a spellcaster - is overpowered for something that can be bought in chapter
    2, and so this component moves it into Throne of Bhaal (see the spoilers
    for details).</p>
    <p><strong>Make the Healing and Resurrection powers of the Rod of Resurrection into separate powers (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p> Having a magic item which not only restores its target to life but also heals them fully is extremely powerful. This component mildly tones down this
  power, by giving the rod separate resurrection and healing powers. It can still restore its target to life, but they have only one hit point; it can also cast
  a Heal spell on living targets.
    <p><strong>Change Carsomyr so that its dispel-on-contact power gains a saving throw (BG2EE,BG2,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Carsomyr (the holy paladin sword) dispels all magical protections instantly on hitting its target, which drastically changes the flavour of many battles (notably
  those with mages and priests, and to a lesser extent with dragons). This component (which was borrowed directly from Demivrgvs' and Mike1072's Item Revisions) grants
  a saving throw against this effect, which makes it useful but less transformative.
  <h3><a name="misctweaks" id="misctweaks">Gameplay Tweaks</a></h3>
  <p> These components could equally well be called "miscellaneous tweaks". </p>
  <p><strong>Faster Bears</strong></p>
   <p>"If you're in the woods, and you run into an angry bear, don't worry about
    it. Bears can't move very fast, you can outdistance it at a brisk walk".</p> 
  <p>It's unrealistic that <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> bears
    can't catch up with the party. This component tweaks their movement rate (when hostile)
    until it's about the same as for humans. This also makes the druid's bear
    shapeshift less annoying. </p> 
    <p><strong>Grant large, flying, non-solid or similar creatures immunity to Web and Entangle</strong></p>
  <p>
  Logically, things like Fire Elementals, Grey Oozes, and Giants ought to be unaffected by Web and Entangle effects. This component grants them immunity to those effects. Affected creatures are Elementals (all except small Earth), djinnis, efreetis, anything larger and stronger than an ogre (which basically means umber hulks, shambling mounds, large demons, giants, otyughs, and wyverns), magical flying swords, and oozes and slimes.</p>

  <p><strong>More realistic wolves and dogs (TUTU,BGT,BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p>In the real world, wolves rather rarely attack humans; indeed, they normally keep their distance. In the Sword Coast, though, wolves are
  apparently ruthless, fearless predators that think nothing of attacking even large parties of heavily armed adventurers.
  (And, as a corollary, even wilderness-oriented types like rangers and druids spend much of their time fighting off attacks from 
  implacable wolf packs.)</p>
  <p>This component makes the behaviour of wolves (and also wild dogs) a bit more realistic. They won't <b>usually</b> attack humans
  (they still do sometimes: it's been a harsh winter and game is scarce). They'll generally retreat if more than a few of them are injured or
  killed. If you approach them, they might take a bite out of you, but just as likely, they'll keep their distance.</p>
  <p>This component has no effect on non-"normal" wolves (dire wolves, winter wolves and the like), since for all I know,
  they really <b>are</b> ruthless predators. Its main point is to spare the author (who rather likes wolves) the heartache
  of perpetually having to cut them down and listen to the rather sad yelp they make when you kill them.</p>

  <p><strong>Improved shapeshifting</strong></p>
<p>This component (inspired in part by Wesley Weimer's Shapeshifter Rebalancing component) modifies all of the druid innate shapeshift abilities (and the druid/cleric elemental-shapeshift HLA)
to be useable instantly (that is, without requiring a six-second cooldown before the next spell can be cast). It does so by creating "symbolic paws":
if you equip one, you instantly shapeshift. Other than that, the effects of the shapeshift are largely the same as previously, though some of the ability score
and attack bonuses have been tweaked slightly. Note that shapeshifting still blocks spellcasting. </p>
<p>If you have both this component and the "improved priests" component installed, enemy druids will use improved shapeshifting. </p>
  <p><strong>Make party members less likely to die irreversibly</strong></p>
  <p>This component tries to prevent "chunking", the annoying permanent death of your
    character when you're reduced below -10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym>.
    Characters who get reduced to 0 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> or
    below just die in the usual fashion and can be resurrected. It isn't possible
    to prevent quite all forms of chunking (massive damage from fire, in particular, still seems to cause chunking fairly reliably), but this component should make it
    a rarer occurrence. This may be useful in the later stages of the game,
    when melee opponents often do 30-40 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage
    per blow - that 10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> safety margin
    starts to feel slender. </p>
    <p><strong>Reduced reputation increase</strong></b>
  <p>In general, if you're playing a half-way honorable character in BG2, your reputation fairly rapidly reaches 20 and stays there. The idea of this component
  is to slow down the rate at which you gain reputation: you can choose the degree of slowdown.</p>
  <p>In more detail: any time you would have gained 2 or more reputation points, you gain one fewer point than you should have. Any time you would have gained one,
  it's decided at random whether you actually do gain it, according to the probability you choose at install time.</p>


  <p><strong>Allow player to choose BG1 <acronym
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> proficiencies and skills (TUTU,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>At the moment the various <acronym
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> who join your party have their existing
    proficiencies, thief skills etc. determined for you according to what the
    designers of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and/or Tutu had
    in mind. There's nothing wrong with this, but it can be interesting - especially
    if you've played several times - to have more flexibility.</p> 
  <p>This component gives you the chance to select each character's proficiencies
    from scratch. It does so in a slightly convoluted way (to get around game-engine
    difficulties): when a new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> joins
    your party, they start at level 0. They immediately go up a level, so you
    get to choose their starting skills. As soon as you've levelled them, they
    gain enough experience to go up to about the level of the <acronym 
title="Player Character">PC</acronym>, and you can give them any remaining proficiencies.</p> 
  <p>This differs from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks version (which is overwritten) because
    you get to choose proficiencies even for 1st-level characters. The component
    only works for the "core" <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in
    <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, not for any <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> added
    by someone else's mod (or for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>).
    It won't work for a given <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> if you install it after you've already
    entered their area.</p> 
        <p>Note that at present this component is not available for the Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate. (I haven't yet found the time to get my head around how BGEE handles NPCs.)</p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>:the patch takes a few seconds to come into effect.
    If there's a 3-4 second pause when your character's statistics (hit points,
    say) aren't right, don't worry about it.</p> 
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Occasionally this component seems to give odd results for people; be warned. (Trying to mess around with them during the above 3-4 second pause seems to be the reason.) There is a much more stable and powerful version of this mod due to Nythrun available at the Gibberlings 3 site; however, that version cannot be used during an ongoing game.)</p>

    <p><strong>Allow BG1 <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> pairs
      to separate (BGEE,TUTU,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>One of the more frustrating aspects of <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> is that many of the more interesting <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> come in inseparable pairs (Khalid
    and Jaheira, Minsc and Dynaheir, etc.) Of course, it's always possible to
    get round this by leaving one member of a pair in a building or getting them
    killed, but it does spoil the suspension of disbelief a bit.</p> 
  <p>This component allows you to separate the pairs. If you kick one member
    of a pair out of the party, then the other still leaves - but if you speak
    to one member of a pair and invite them to join up, you get a dialogue option
    to take them but not their partner.</p>

  <p><strong>BG1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> go to inns (BGEE,TUTU,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>One of the nice features of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is
    the ability to ask <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
    meet you somewhere else, rather than just getting them to stand around forlornly.
    This component introduces this feature for the "core" <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. You can send them to the Friendly
    Arm inn, the Elfsong tavern in Baldur's Gate (from chapter 5), the Nashkel
    Inn (if you've been to Nashkel), or the Jovial Juggler in Beregost (if you've
    been to Beregost). You can't send them there from Balduran's Isle, the Ice
    Island, the Candlekeep dungeons, or the lower levels of Durlag's Tower..</p>
  <p>To send someone to an inn, first kick them out of the party. Then talk to
    them - you should be given the opportunity to ask them to go to an inn and
    await you there.</p> 
  <p>This component isn't compatible with the similarly-named <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> component "<acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> wait at inns". Install whichever
    one you want (you won't be allowed to install more than one). There isn't
    much difference between the two - the dialogue is handled a bit differently,
    and this version lets you send people to more inns.</p>

  <p><strong>Move BG1 <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to more
      convenient locations (BGEE,TUTU,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Many of the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> are inconveniently located - either
    at places where you can't get to at all until late in the game (e.g. Baldur's
    Gate, the Cloakwood), or places where you in principle could get to but realistically
    wouldn't. This makes it annoying to experiment with varying your party: you
    have to leave extended gaps in your party until quite late, or unrealistically
    sneak into later-game areas to act on your Reload Knowledge of where someone
    is.</p> 
  <p>This component moves as many as possible of the <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to locations where you are likely
    to run into them fairly early in the game. Obviously it doesn't move all
    by any means (many have plot-related reasons for their locations).</p> 
  <p>See <a href="#npcs">here</a> for details of who has been moved and
    to where. Note that this component will only work if you start a new game.</p> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> also
    moves some <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. If you've got <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> installed, this component will only
    move those <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> (Shar-Teel
    and Viconia) whom <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> leaves alone. </p> 



  <p><strong>Allow Yeslick to use axes (TUTU,BGT,BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p>It seems appropriate that Yeslick, who is a dwarven fighter-cleric, ought
    to be able to use the traditional dwarven weapon; this component allows him
    to.</p> 
  <p>(There is a loophole here: due to the way the game engine works, this actually
    allows all fighter-clerics (not just Yeslick) to use axes. Yeslick is actually
    the only <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> fighter-cleric
    in the core game but it might affect third-party <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, or your primary character (and,
    for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> users, it will affect
    Anomen). If you want to take advantage of this then be my guest, but it wasn't
    the intended function of the component.)</p> 

   <p><strong>Skip the Candlekeep tutorial sections (TUTU,BGT,BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p>The Prologue to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> is a perfectly
    good tutorial in the Infinity Engine for complete beginners. By the time
    you return to it for the Nth time,
    it's unutterably tedious - but you more-or-less have to do it, because even
    the small amount of gold and <acronym 
title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> it gives you is pretty vital for later.
    It doesn't really even add colour, because realism is always being spoiled
    by these damn monks telling you which button to press.</p>
    <p>This component gives you two ways around this problem.</p> The first option (which leaves the tedium unchanged but resotres the verisimilitude) just removes the green-robed monks.
   The less-than-serious alternative choice, inspired by <acronym
title="Pocket Plane Group">PPG</acronym>'s Dungeon-Be-Gone, lets you skip the
    whole thing: at the start of the adventure, a guard will come up to you and
    give you the chance to collect all the cash and <acronym
title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> from him. He'll give you a decent interval
    to shop, and then teleport you direct to Gorion ready for the start-of-game
    ambush.</p> 
  <p>Be warned that the dialogue with the guard is unrealistic and written for
    laughs. Realism
    is restored once you start talking to Imoen and Gorion.</p> 
  <p><strong>Allow the Cowled Wizards to detect spellcasting in most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla (BG2,BG2EE,BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>The Cowled Wizards claim to ban magic everywhere in Athkatla; in practice, though, they only complain if you cast spells out of doors.
  This component extends their watch to most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla (there are a few exceptions, mostly places where wizards live (e.g. Prebek's tower)
  or where it's likely that the owners have made arrangements with the Cowled Wizards (e.g. the Copper Coronet).</p>
  <p><strong>Increase the price of a licence to practice magic in Athkatla BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>The default price for a magic licence from the Cowled Wizards is 5,000gp. This component allows you to increase it to an amount between 10,000gp and 50,000gp, depending
  on which option you choose during installation.</p>
  <p><strong>Increase the price asked by Gaelan Baele BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component aims both to make it more realistic for the player to linger
    in chapter 2 of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> (which in gameplay
    terms is often rather tempting, but is hard to justify on roleplaying grounds)
    and to add an extra challenge by restricting the player's wealth in the first
    part of the game. As everyone knows, in the unmodded game Gaelan asks the
    player to provide 20,000gp. With this component installed, he will want more
    - between 40,000gp and 120,000gp, depending on which option you choose during
    installation. </p> 
<p><strong>Make Freedom scrolls available earlier BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
Scrolls of Freedom (the spell that reverses Imprisonment) are fairly thin on the ground early in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>, whereas Liches love Imprisoning people. This component makes a few scrolls of Freedom available from Athkatlan stores (the Coppor Coronet and the Adventurer's Mart, in fact.)
  <p><strong>Make Watchers' Keep accessible between <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> BG2, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>In roleplaying terms, the natural time to explore Watchers' Keep is between
    the end of Shadows of Amn and the start of Throne of Bhaal. Before chapter
    4 you're probably too weak; in chapters 6 and 7 of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> you're
    in a desperate race against time; in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>,
    the way the start works makes it difficult not to take random time off from
    urgent business to explore Watchers' Keep. </p> 
  <p> This component moves the start location of Throne of Bhaal to Watchers'
    Keep, so that you're moved there immediately after the end of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>.
    You can then explore <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> to your
    heart's content. When you want to start <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>,
    just leave <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> via the world map.
    You can still return to <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> after
    leaving. </p>
  <p> Be warned: you don't have any stable base, or any way to change your party,
    as long as you're starting at <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym>.
    If you find you need either, you'll need to do the first part of <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    Similarly, although you could start a new game of <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> using
    this component, this is only a good idea if you're masochistic enough to
    want to solo Watchers' Keep with a starting-level <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> character! </p> 
  <p> This component is only available on Windows versions of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>, and isn't at present available on BG2EE.</p>
      <p><b>Warning:</b>If you install this component you will <b>not</b> be able to access Watcher's Keep during the Shadows of Amn part of the game. This is to prevent a persistent
      bug, which I've been unable to track down, whereby going to WK during SoA triggers the chapter counter to advance to chapter 8.</p>



  <p><strong>Recover lost items from Hell (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p> Because you're transported directly from Hell at the end of chapter 7,
    any items on the ground (notably, those dropped by slaughtered companions)
      are lost in the lower planes. This component (suggested by the bigg) fixes
      this problem: your items will be on the ground waiting for you when you
      start chapter 8. The component is compatible with the &quot;Make Watchers
      Keep accessible between <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>&quot; component, and you can install
  them in either order.</p>
     <p><strong>Randomize the maze in Watcher's Keep (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component is for the benefit of people who've now basically got the Watcher's Keep teleport maze memorized. It randomly rearranges the maze to
  one of three different alternative configurations. Don't install or reinstall this component while you're exploring the maze (before you enter it, or after you've
  left it, will be fine).</p>

   <p><strong>Remove unrealistically helpful items from certain areas (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>Vampires do not stockpile stakes in their lairs; magic golems are not usually
    found near stashes of nonmagical weapons; demons' lairs are not usually stocked
    with books explaining how to eliminate their defences and wands stocked with
    the requisite spells; trolls are not generally found in places filled with
    fire and acid arrows; cities under siege do not generally have large quantities
    of +3 weapons for sale in bars. But in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> all
    these things occur. Presumably this is intended to reduce frustration, but
    I just find it spoils my suspension of disbelief. This component tries to
    remove all such implausibly-placed items. (Obviously, things like stakes
    and fire arrows are still plentifully available, but you can't count on just
    finding them lying around where you want them.) </p>
  <p><strong>Remove unrealistically convenient ammunition from the game (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  Similarly, the game has vast stashes of ammunition lying around for the taking,
  presumably because the developers thought you'd be bored of having to buy it.
  This component removes all the ammunition from containers, for those
  who find things just a bit too convenient to be realistic.
<p>This component can be fine-tuned. You can choose to remove only the non-magical ammunition, to remove all the ammunition except those nice +3/+4 items you find in Throne of Bhaal, or just to remove everything.</p>

  <p><strong>Delay the arrival of the "bonus merchants" in the Adventurers' Mart and the Copper Coronet (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component causes the "bonus merchants" (Deidre and Joluv) to appear a little later in the game (by default they are in the Adventurers' Mart and the Copper
  Coronet, respectively, as soon as you go there). One of them (chosen at random) will appear once you've started Chapter Six; the other will appear once you've either completed
  four of the "stronghold quests" or recovered the Rhyn Lanthorn.</p>
  <p>You don't need to have the bonus merchants already installed (e.g. through Tweak Pack) to run this component; if you do, it won't matter.</p>
  <p><strong>Treat mages' and priests' High-Level Abilities as innate abilities rather than memorisable spells (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component causes the 10th level spells that mages get as High-Level Abilities, and the Quest spells that priests get likewise,
  to become disentangled from existing 9th level mage spells and 7th level priest spells. If installed, 10th level and Quest spells
  are no longer added to the character's list of spells to learn. Instead, each can be cast once per day in addition to the
  character's normal spells. Each spell can only be taken once. Note that clones (Projected Images and Simulacra) of the spellcaster do not get High-level abilities.</p>
  <p>The component should be compatible with other mods (notably Refinements) which change the High-Level Ability system.
  If it is installed, SCS mages and priests will also receive High-Level Abilities in this way.</p>
  <p>I'm grateful to TheBigg and Vilcakis, from whose rather similar mod I took significant inspiration, and to Ardanis for
  the suggestion that each ability should only be available once, which changed me from a strong opponent of this change to
  a (cautious) supporter.</p>





 <h3><a name="cosmetictweaks" id="cosmetictweaks">Cosmetic and ease-of-use tweaks</a></h3>
  <p><strong>Ease-of-use party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p>
  <p>This <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script, suitable
    for all characters, is not intended to help you fight difficult battles,
    but it might make your life simpler (especially where pre-casting spells
    is concerned - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> virtually requires you to do a lot of precombat spellcasting
    of long-duration spells, but it's tedious to do manually.) The <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> has
    5 functions: </p>
  <ol> 
    <li>The character will fight, prioritising opponents who are not immobile
      and helpless, not fighting if they're trying to Turn Undead, and not wasting
      Melf's Minute Meteors, Energy Blades or Invisibility (the idea of this <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is
      to help you mop up weak opponents, so it conserves resources). You can
      shift the character between melee (D) and ranged weapons (F) using the
      hotkeys. <br />
      If you'd rather that your character did not enter melee, you can toggle
      melee off by pressing (K). Characters with melee toggled off will fight
      if enemies are in weapon range but won't be proactive about getting into
      range. </li> 
    <li>The character will cast some long-duration spells when out of combat.
      There are 4 settings for this, which you can toggle through using (S).
      On setting 1, the character uses no spells. On setting 2 and up, the character
      will cast all of the following spells if they are memorized (and not already
      active): Stoneskin, Iron Skins, Armor, Melf's Minute Meteors, Goodberry. </li> 
    <li>On setting 2 and up, the character will consume Goodberries if injured
      and out of combat. On setting 3 and up, the character will also consume
      potions of healing. On setting 4, the character will consume potions of
      extra-healing. </li> 
    <li>On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically activate the following
      items once per day: the Cloak of the Stars; the Gargoyle Boots; the Belt
      of Fortitude. </li> 
      <li> On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically cast low-level healing spells on the 
      party if they have them. The casting is highly accelerated and cannot be done in combat; 
      characters will only cast healing spells of a level 2 or more below the highest level of spells
      which they can cast.</li>
    <li>The character will cast some spells, by hotkey, on the whole party. This
      casting is highly accelerated, cannot be done in combat, and only casts
      on characters who are not already protected. Its main function is for later
      in the game when you can afford to carry enough spells to protect the whole
      party. The hot-keys are: C for Chaotic Commands; V for Death Ward; B for
      Protection from Fire, Protection from Lightning, and Protection from Magic
      Energy; Z for the paladin's Protection from Evil. (The latter key is already
      allocated to a hotkey (sleep) - sorry, I was running out of hotkeys. To
      use it you'll need to disable Z in the Configuration program. Later versions
      of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> will
      feature a more flexible hotkey-allocation system.) </li> 
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Move Boo out of quick access and into Minsc's pack</strong></p>
  <p>I love Boo, really I do, but it's infuriating that he eats up one of Minsc's
    quickslots. This patch just moves him into a slot in Minsc's backpack. It will only work if you start a new game (or, for BG1, at least install before arriving at Nashkel). </p>

      <p><strong>Remove blur effect from the displacer cloak</strong></p>
  <p>Like it says really: this removes the annoying blurry graphic when someone
    wears the displacer cloak.</p>
  <p><strong>Remove animation from the Cloak of Mirroring (leave it for other
      spells and effects that use the same graphic) (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>The Cloak of Mirroring creates an annoying spherical animation that is a
    pain to have around permanently. The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak
    Pack eliminates that animation entirely from the game, but that can be a
    nuisance for <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    </acronym> as the animation, annoying or not, is a good way of telling
    which mages have which defensive spells running. This component just removes
    the animation from the Cloak, leaving it in place for other spells and items. </p> 
  <p><strong>Stackable ankheg shells, winterwolf pelts and wyvern heads (TUTU/BGT/BGEE)</strong> </p>
  These aren't infinitely stackable in the "standard" inventory-management mods,
  or at least they weren't last time I checked.
   <p> <strong> Ensure Shar-Teel doesn't die in the original challenge (TUTU/BGT/BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p> Shar-Teel is rather fragile: it's easy to kill her by mistake in the battle
    where you recruit her. This component guarantees that she survives the battle. </p> 

  <h3><a name="aitweaks" id="aitweaks"><acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> enhancements</a></h3>
<p>The distinction between this section and the next two ("tactical challenges") is a bit arbitrary, but basically components in this section either don't alter creatures' abilities at all, or do so in a relatively low-key way.</p>
<p><strong>Initialise AI</strong></p>
<p>This component has no in-game effect, but carries out some preprocessing that's necessary for any of the other AI/tactical components to function.</p>
<p>(For experts: it constructs a centralised list of which spells and items use opcode 206, builds lots of prebuff and instant-effect spells, and constructs the "cursed wound" item used by clay golems.)</p>

  <p><strong>Smarter general <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the generic <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> used
    in melee and ranged combat throughout <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>.
    In addition, it rearranges creatures' choices of proficiencies and (where appropriate) high-level (non-spellcaster) abilities, assigns kits to some fighters and thieves who don't currently have them, and ensures that creatures have correct (or at any rate consistent!) saving throws, attack rolls, levels, and kit abilities.
    It will mostly affect fighters, thieves, and monsters without large numbers
    of special abilities. </p> 
  <p> Main features of this component include: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Enemies will try to choose targets more intelligently. This will be most
      noticeable for ranged attackers - the game's engine makes it difficult
      to safely tell melee fighters to do much more than "attack nearest". </li> 
    <li>Melee attackers will fairly quickly notice that their opponent is immune
      to their attacks (if you're protected from magic weapons, for instance)
      and will try someone else; ranged attackers will similarly notice spells
      like Physical Mirror. </li> 
    <li>Thieves will use their backstab and hide-in-shadows power as much as
      they can, and will avoid wasting backstabs on characters with Stoneskin
      or Mirror Image. </li> 
    <li>Enemies will use potions if they have them (though this component doesn't
      give them any). </li>
    <li>Enemies with class abilities (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Kai)
      or high-level abilities (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Whirlwind
      Attack) will use them.</li>
    <li>Enemies above a certain minimum intelligence will usually prioritise opponents
      who are not stunned, held or otherwise helpless. From their point of view,
      they're fighting to win, and if they kill all non-helpless opponents they
      can finish off the helpless ones at their leisure. (They will, however, finish off nearby vulnerable opponents in preference to chasing up distant ones.)</li>
    <li>In Baldur's Gate I, various creatures who foolishly moved up to talk to the party, or sat immobile while being surrounded, will now initiate conversation at a distance.</li>
    <li>About a dozen (in BG1) or about seventy (in BG2) creatures now have kits assigned. Kits used are archer, assassin, barbarian, berserker, kensai, swashbuckler, and wizard slayer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Better calls for help</strong></p> 
    <p>This component substantially improves the (in BG1 almost nonexistent, in BG2 rudimentary) scripting for monsters to help one another.
    Even the stupidest monsters will fight in groups (so the advance-a-few-steps-at-a-time
    strategy will fail); intelligent monsters will call out to nearby allies.
    There are some ways to abuse this component but generally it seems to strike
    a good compromise between amazingly unrealistic behaviour on the one hand,
    and the entire map emptying towards you on the other.</p>
   <p><strong><p>High-Level Abilities for spellcasters (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
   <p>This component allows high-level spellcasters in BG2 to use High-Level Abilities (HLAs). The component has no effect unless the Smarter Mages and/or Smarter Priests component is installed (really it's just a component choice for those components, not a component in itself). There are five options, allowing HLAs to be available for only special creatures, or all sufficiently-high-level spellcasters, in Shadows of Amn or Throne of Bhaal or both.</p>
   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> The option is available to let all Shadows of Amn spellcasters use HLAs, but this will make some early parts of the game extremely dangerous, and I don't really recommend it. If you ignore this warning and then get Dragon Breath dumped on your twelth-level party, don't blame me.</p>

  <p><strong>Smarter mages</strong></p>
  <p>This component drastically improves the intelligence of pretty much all
    the arcane spellcasters (liches, mages, fighter/mages, thief/mages, bards)
    in the game. It does so in three ways: </p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>Better choices of spells and sequencers. The spell lists of mages are
      systematically restructured to swap useless for useful spells. I've tended
      to err on the side of variety over usefulness: Maze is less useful than
      Horrid Wilting but it's still fairly useful, so I've kept it; but Larloch's Minor Drain just can't compete with Magic Missile, so out it goes. Enemy
      sequencers, spell triggers, contingencies and the like are all completely
      reworked. Both the spellswap and the sequencer choice are done at random
      (though occasionally I've tweaked it for specific mages) - I think an 18th
      level wizard has about 4000 different possible combinations of contingencies
      and sequencers! Spell choices will change each time you reinstall <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
      </acronym>; sequencer and contingency choices will change each time you
      reload.  </p>
      (Whether mages use High-Level Abilities will depend on whether you installed the appropriate component above.)

    </li>
    <li>Much better targeting. <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> mages are very, very careful to choose sensible targets
        for their spells and to avoid silly or unrealistic actions. They will
        renew magic defences as soon as they are destroyed, try to show some
        discernment in when to use antimagic attacks, prefer to target fighters
        with Dire Charm and mages with Power Word: Kill, etc. Multi-class characters
        will try to intersperse their mage and non-mage abilities. There is quite
        a lot of randomness, though - partly because it's tactically unwise to
        use too-fixed a strategy, but mostly for variety.
      <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> tries
        extremely hard not to cheat. It's impossible within the engine to be
        completely certain of this, but as far as I can manage, no <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym> mage does anything that the party can't (assuming that you
        have installed the Spell Tweaks components of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
        </acronym>). There are two exceptions: </p>
      <ul> 
        <li>As noted in the "Improved Fiends" component (below), if you install that
          component then <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-summoned
          fiends behave a little differently from <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>-summoned
          ones. </li> 
        <li>I assume that <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> wizards
          (who have years and decades more practice than the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>)
          can specify the conditions on which their contingencies go off with
          more discernment than the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
          so I haven't restricted myself to the conditions that the game allows
          for <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> spellcasters. Otherwise,
          I have kept to the standard Contingency rules even when the unmodded
          game breaks them (no choosing different targets in the same sequencer;
          no 9th level spells in Chain Contingency, etc.) </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> mages
        obey the rules on invisibility: only spells which can be cast at a point
        on the ground can be used against improved-invisible opponents. So they
        will cast Horrid Wilting or Fireball at your improved-invisible character,
        but not Breach or Magic Missile. One unavoidable game-engine, glitch,
        though, is that (unlike with <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> spells)
        an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-cast Fireball
        will land at the feet of its target even if s/he has moved after casting
        began. I can't do much about this. Note that sequencers cannot be, and
        are not, targetted at invisible opponents (even if they contain area-effect
        spells); but note also that liches can see through invisibility (even
        in the unmodded game). </p>
      <p> Out of mercy, enemy mages won't cast Imprisonment on the main character.
        If you're masochistic enough to want to change this, enter CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("DMWWImprisonPlayer","GLOBAL",1). </p> 
    </li> 
    <li><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> allows
      mages to cast some spells instantly, to simulate casting before battle
      begins (in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> it's very difficult
      to script enemies to do the sort of pre-battle buffing that <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>s
      can do). They will always do this with any spell with a duration of more
      than a couple of hours (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Stoneskin,
      Melf's Minute Meteors). There are five options, though, for the casting
      of short duration spells. (Note that whichever option you choose, mages
      will still use contingencies and spell sequencers.)
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Option 1: </strong>Mages are always allowed to cast spells
          instantly at the start of combat. This is basically the same way magic
          works in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym>,
          and is tactically the hardest challenge; however, on occasion it might
          appear a bit unrealistic. </li> 
        <li><strong>Option 2: </strong>Mages are allowed to cast spells instantly
          at the start of combat only when they are created near the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> enemy
          mages teleporting in to ambush you). This is basically how Tactics
          handles this (though I think I keep to the rules more strictly than
          Tactics does). It's somewhat less challenging, but since even casters
          whom you catch off-guard have contingencies and sequencers to defend
          themselves with, mages can slam up defences pretty quickly. </li>
        <li><strong>Option 3: </strong>Mages never cast spells instantly. (Though,
          again, they can very quickly use contingencies and sequencers to defend
          themselves.) </li> 
        <li><strong>Option 4: </strong>Option 1 for BG1, option 2 for BG2. The logic here is that many mages in BG2 teleport in, but hardly any do in BG1 - partly because they are lower level, partly because of different design philosophies. (For what it's worth, this is my own preferred option.)</li>
        <li><strong> Option 5:</strong>Mages use short-duration spells at the start of combat, but only if the difficulty is set to Hard or Insane.</li>
      </ul> 
    </li> 
  </ol>
  This component also makes some systematic adjustments in the levels of <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s.
  The unmodded game is very inconsistent: it often makes casters much too-low-level
  for the spells they have (this matters because many spells have different effects
  at different levels, and also because Dispel Magic depends on the difference
  in levels between the casters. <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
  </acronym> goes through every arcane caster in the game and modifies their
  level according to the following rule: an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is
  raised to the lowest level consistent with all the spells s/he knows, except
  that no-one is raised to a level that would let them cast higher-level spells
  than they actually have, and (almost) no-one has their level reduced by <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
  II</acronym>. This is then fine-tuned manually.
  <p>Finally, many wizards will be specialists of one sort or another
  (I use necromancers, conjurers, invokers and enchanters), and this should - hopefully - lead to a little more variety in the kind of spell use you see.</p>
  <p>The component uses whatever memorization rules are in the game. If you've installed a component which changes the number of spells a caster of a given level
  can learn, this will apply to enemy mages too; if you've opted for High-Level Abilities to work as innate abilities rather than spells, this is how mages will use them.</p>
  <p> Since Irenicus is a mage, this component upgrades him too. He gains no
    new spells, but he should use his existing spells more effectively, and this
    makes him a lot more dangerous (particularly in his final incarnation). Illasera
    is a fighter-mage in the unmodded (non-Ascension) game, so if you don't install
    Ascension then she gets upgraded. If you have the "Smarter Clerics" component
    then Sendai is also upgraded (unless you've installed "Tougher Sendai" from the Oversight mod). </p>
  <p><strong>Smarter Priests</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the intelligence of the clerics and fighter-clerics
    in the game, in much the same way as the "Smarter Mages" component does for
    mages etc. It has the same three pre-casting options; note, though, that
    since clerics do not have access to sequencers or contingencies, enemy clerics
    are at a huge disadvantage on options 2-5. (For this reason, my own preference is to use option 1 for clerics.)</p>
  <p><strong>Potions for <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s</strong></p>
  <p>Potions are one of the most effective and cheap ways for a humanoid creature
    to enhance its combat ability. The party collect literally hundreds of them
    through the game and can easily buy
    hundreds more; it's not that realistic that enemy <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    don't have them. This component gives healing and protection potions of various
    sorts to humanoid <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s; it
    also gives combat-boosting potions to fighters and invisibility potions to
    thieves. The potion allocation is based on level (the higher level your opponent,
    the more likely he is to have good potions); it also requires a higher level
    for a Throne of Bhaal <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to
    have potions than for a Shadows of Amn one, since Throne of Bhaal is crawling
    with mid-level grunts, and a higher level for a Shadows of Amn NPC than for a BG1 one.
  <p> This component "plays fair", in the sense that potions are given to <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    when they are created, not beamed into existence just in time to be drunk.
    This means you'll probably end up with (even) more potions if you use this
    component, since you'll be able to steal a few from enemies who are killed
    before being able to use them. However (as Alesia_BH pointed out to me on the Bioware boards) it's not exactly unrealistic
    that glass bottles get smashed in the heat of battle. So you can choose any of six different rules for what fraction of potions are recoverable. </p>
  <p>The Superior Healing potion only gets given to enemies in Throne of Bhaal
    (to preserve a flavour difference between the two components). </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Spiders</strong></p>
    <p>This component enhances the AI (and in some cases, the abilities) of most of the  spiders you
    meet in the game. Its effects will be most noticeable in BG1 - it makes the Cloakwood,
    in particular, quite challenging. Basically, there are two main changes: giant spiders cast (single-target) webs every few rounds, and phase spiders teleport
    more effectively. All spiders also have an increased predisposition to attack webbed opponents and poison them.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Smarter dryads and sirines (TUTU/BGT/BGEE)</strong></p>
    <p>This component improves the intelligence of sirines - their charms will
    be better targetted and they make more intelligent use of their invisibility.
    It also adds a little defensive magic to the hamadryad of the cloakwood -
    she is hopefully a little more of a challenge now.</p> 

  <p><strong>Slightly smarter carrion crawlers (TUTU/BGT/BGEE)</strong></p>
  <p>This small component gives carrion crawlers a slightly smarter script - they know enough to continue paralysing moving opponents before feeding.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter basilisks</strong> (TUTU/BGT/BGEE)</p>
  <p>This component spreads basilisks' gaze attacks around, rather than mechanically
    petrifying the nearest target. More importantly, it gives them the intelligence
    to see (eventually) that some targets are immune altogether, and to concentrate
    on others.</p>


  <p><strong>Improved Golems (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a 
  sensible range, makes them immune to Lower Resistance and to poison, and <b>tries</b> to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind
  barricades.  It also fixes an animation glitch in the Iron Golem animation - this hopefully makes iron golems a bit prettier when they attack and blow clouds. As of version 22, it also gives clay golems a cursed-wound weapon, as in PnP Dungeons & Dragons. (You can turn this off before installing - see the Customisation section.)</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Fiends (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component overhauls the "Fiends" (i.e., Baatezu and Tanar'ri, aka Devils
    and Demons) throughout <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    More than any other component of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym>, this component not only upgrades their scripting but actually
    gives them a variety of new magical abilities. I've based the abilities the
    fiends received on a combination of 2nd and 3rd edition pen-and-paper <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>;
    details can be found in the Spoilers section. However, the fiends' basic
    combat abilities and defences remain essentially unchanged: other than a
    certain amount of systemisation (where two similar-looking fiends have wildly
    different immunities, for instance) I've left their hit rolls, damage, immunities,
    magic resistance etc pretty much alone. In fact, in one or two cases I've removed a power
    (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> permanent haste) that seemed
    to be added as a cheesy way of making a fight harder. </p>
    <p>The component also enforces the fact that fiendly spellcasting is instantaneous and innate, so that fiends do not use up time getting their spells off, and cannot be interrupted.</p>
  <p> This component also makes a substantial change to the way fiend-summoning
    magic works (this is one of the few places where <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> breaks the rule that players and <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    should be treated equally). I assume that enemy spellcasters (who, after
    all, have been learning high-level magic far longer than the party) summon
    demons with whom they have a pre-existing pact. These demons won't attack
    their summoner - and, crucially, will attack the party even if they are protected
    by Protection from Evil. The practical upshot is that the only demons in
    the game now kept at bay by a Pro/Evil are the ones that your party summons.
    This makes summoned demons rather more useful, and you'll see more of them
    being summoned. <strong>Note: this component will only have an effect on
    the game if you also install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    </acronym>'s "Smarter Mages" and/or "Smarter Priests" components; unmodded
    priests and mages continue to use the original version</strong>. </p> 
    <p>The component also offers the option to increase fiends' hit points by about 50 percent. (In playtesting, I found that this led to more interesting battles, with fiends having more opportunities to use their powers.)</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter Genies (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the various genies (djinni, efreet, and the like)
    in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>. Mostly this is done by
    improving their scripts and systematising the rather chaotic list of spells
    and abilities that different genies get (in the original game, if you charmed
    a genie you'd see that it had a totally different list of spells from the
    ones it was actually using!) However, the component also changes summoned
    genies so that they count as "Gated" rather than "Summoned"; the practical
    consequence of this is that they are immune to Death Spell. This makes genie-summoning
    rather more useful. </p> 
  <p> As with the "Smarter Fiends", component, this component makes genies' spell use instantaneous and uninterruptable, and has an option to
    give genies a 50 percent hit point boost. </p>
  <p><strong>Smarter Celestials (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the way in which summoned devas and planetars use
    their magical and combat powers. It only affects celestials summoned by enemy <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s,
    and it doesn't grant any extra abilities - it just uses the existing abilities
    more effectively. </p> 
  <p> As with the "Smarter Fiends", component, this component makes celestials' spell use instantaneous and uninterruptable, and has an option to give celestials a 50 percent hit point boost. </p>
  <p><strong>Smarter Dragons (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the intelligence of all the dragons in the game (including Adalon and Fll'Yissetat, but
   Abazigal is only modified if you also install the "SCS AI for Ascension" component).
 It <strong>tries</strong> to do this without granting
    them new abilities (the main grey area is exactly how many spells dragons
    should have: the unmodded game is somewhat inconsistent about it). At any
    rate, in play you should - hopefully - see dragons being a bit more discerning
    with their targeting and their spell priorities. </p>
  <p> The component also systemises dragons' immunities to be consistent through the game, modifies dragon breath to penetrate magic resistance
    (the unmodded game is a bit inconsistent on this point, but since the <em>spell</em> Dragon's
    Breath goes through <acronym title="Magic Resistance">MR</acronym>, presumably
    real dragon breath should too!) and lets dragons cast spells at a more realistic
    level (usually 15-25 or so). </p> 
  <p> As with the "Smarter Fiends", component, this component also lets dragons cast their spells instantly and uninterruptably. </p>
  <p>The component has an option to increase dragon hit points very substantially - tripling them, in fact. At the moment dragons have about 200 hp, which by the late stages of Shadows of Amn really isn't enough to go toe-to-toe with an entire party.
Somehow, it doesn't seem right that dragons have to rely on Stoneskin and Protection from Magic Weapons - this component gives them the ability to hang around in battle for longer.
   <p><strong>Smarter Beholders (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of
    the beholders, gauths, elder orbs and hive mothers in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    (It basically tries to do it non-cheesily, but it's hard to define this exactly
    since beholder powers are almost all scripted). Beholders get to use their
    eyestalks once per round each, but they will tend to manage to get through
    more of them in a round; their targeting has also been drastically improved
    (the new scripts are about 150 times the length of the old ones!) </p> 
  <p> In accordance with <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> 2nd edition
    rules, beholders are now immune to most (not all) of their own eyestalks,
    which makes them more willing to bombard their way through Spell Deflection.
    I have removed the Disintegrate eyestalk power (I don't like scripting for
    powers that require you to reload on a failed save) but I have added a Telekinesis
    eyestalk (more for fun than for increased challenge). And I have borrowed,
    with thanks, the Quest Pack component which allows beholders to lose their
    eyestalks when damaged. Beholders are also unable to use eyestalk powers
    when blinded (although their allies may use anti-magic rays to remove the
    blindness). </p>
  <p> Hive mothers use the same range of powers as in the original game, but
    use them more efficiently, and use their eyestalks in the gap while they're
    waiting to cast spells again. Elder orbs were tricky because of the rather
    inconsistent range of powers they show in the unmodded game, but I have interpreted
    them as casting spells just as standard mages do, and as knowing 2 spells
    of each level. Their choice of spell, and of Contingency, Spell Trigger et
    al, has been optimised more, and they too use eyestalk powers while waiting
    to cast again (and show a preference for short-casting-time spells, so as
    to allow more eyestalk use.) </p> 
  <p> It might be worth noting that, even in the unmodded game, hive mothers
    can see through invisibility (though elder orbs cannot). </p>
<p>Beholder eyestalk rays ought to be able to work their way through Spell Turning spells and the like: a few beholder rays ought to be enough to overwhelm a Spell Turning spell (and for that reason, beholders are scripted to use their rays even on protected characters). However, for whatever reason this doesn't seem to work very well in-game. So instead, beholder rays now have a random chance (thirty percent) of dispelling a spell protection on contact; this should work out, on average, to the same thing. This is optional: you can choose whether or not to let beholder rays "burn through" defences in this way.
<p>In addition, you can choose at install time to have beholders use an alternative form of their antimagic ray.
In pen-and-paper D&D, a beholder's eyestalk blocks all magical effects, beneficial or otherwise, on the target for as long as it's
targetted. In BG2, the eye is more powerful: it removes all magical effects, blocks spellcasting for several rounds, but doesn't 
block enemy magic attacks (including the beholder's other eyestalks). Optionally, the beholder antimagic ray blocks <b>all</b> magical
effects, including harmful ones, for one round, and also disables magical activity (spellcasting etc) by the target for one round; this is
supposed to simulate the beholder bathing the target with its antimagic ray for one round. This subcomponent obviously requires different
scripting, so beholders will use their antimagic ray a bit more cautiously if it's installed.
<p>Finally, if Spell Revisions is installed then Beholders will use a Spell-Revisions-style disintegrate ray (at 10th level for
ordinary beholders, 20th level for Hive Mothers). The default in this case is that they <b>do</b> use Disintegrate; entering
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(&quot;DMWWBeholderDisintegrateSR&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,1) will disable it.

  <p><strong>Smarter mind flayers (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the intelligence of the mind-flayers and their kin
    (specifically, it upgrades flayers, ulitharids, vampiric illithids, and the
    Master Brain). It allows the illithids to use a somewhat wider range of abilities
    than before (notably, they have access to a few physical psionic attacks,
    like Ballistic Attack, and they can astrally travel to more convenient bits
    of the battlefield); it significantly improves their targetting; it allows
    them to use each power every 2-4 rounds and choose the most appropriate available
    power; it lets them avoid attacking targets who are immune to their abilities
    or to their physical attacks.</p> 
  <p>There are a variety of options in this component. You can choose whether
    to let mind flayers see invisible opponents (I'm inclined to think that their
    great intelligence and wide range of psionic powers means that invisibility
    is no barrier to them; not everyone agrees, though). You can also choose
    to give mind flayers 50% resistance to melee and missile damage. (The Tactics
    version of smarter mind flayers grants both these powers; both are optional
    in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.)</p> 
  <p> The component also makes a few changes in how psionic powers work. It mildly
    increases the damage done by physical psionic attacks (though not to anything
    like the extent that Tactics does) and it changes "anti-psionic" items so
    that they do not protect from physical psionic attacks. (On my interpretation, "Ballistic
    attack" involves using psionics on a rock, not on a <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>).
    This gives illithids a few more options when facing enemies who are shielded
    from mental attack. The component also systematises illithid magic resistance
    and level, so that all of them are 90% magic resistant (previously there
    were a few exceptions) and the same level. As of version 16, it allows illithids' detonation power to destroy skeletons automatically (in accordance with the 2nd edition rules, as it happens). (This can be disabled at the console.)</p>
  <p> If the "Smarter Mages" component and this one are both installed, the Alhoon
    is also upgraded. I interpret him as a <acronym title="Level 18">L18</acronym> mage
    with the psionic powers of an ulitharid, I also give him the "split mind" psionic
    power, which allows him to cast a spell and use a psionic power in the same
    round. (Yes, purists, this is a valid 2nd edition psionic power!) This guy
    is now fairly dangerous. </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Vampires (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades vampires' intelligence and abilities, roughly in line
  with pen-and-paper Dungeons and Dragons. They should target their magic more effectively, pick on people
  vulnerable to their level drain, and so forth. The component also standardises
  vampire statistics a bit (usually increasing vampire ability scores slightly). It allows vampires to summon wolves, bats, or rats (the bat summoning was
  present in earlier versions but has been toned down), to drink blood (which drains Constitution) as well as draining levels, and to make much more use
  of their various shapeshifting abilities (bat, rat, wolf, gas cloud).</p>
  <p>
<p>This component does affect Bodhi, but only if you don't install the "Improved Bodhi" component (in other words, if you want Bodhi to use her original-game abilities more effectively but don't want to give her the extra powers of that component, install Smarter Vampires but not Improved Bodhi).
  <p><strong>Smarter Githyanki (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the githyanki in the game, mostly through better
    scripting for their psionic powers (those which they demonstrate in-game
    in one way or another), although it does also slightly raise the level of
    some of the stronger gith. It also makes the same general upgrade to psionics
    that the "Smarter Mind Flayers" component does. Finally, it upgrades the
    githyanki lair in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> by the rather
    simple expedient of opening all the doors. ("Sir, just a suggestion, but
    maybe we should fall on our enemies all at once rather than dividing our
    forces into four bite-sized chunks?") </p>
    
    <p><strong>Smarter ToB final villain (BG2, BG2EE, BGT)</strong></p>
This component upgrades the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the final villain of Throne of Bhaal, in both their Ascension and non-Ascension forms. I try fairly hard to use only those abilities actually demonstrated in-game, although I do fix a bug in the non-Ascension version whereby their last form wasn't using quite the right script.
  <p><strong>Smarter Illasera (BG2, BG2EE, BGT - requires Ascension)</strong></p>
This component changes the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the Ascension version of Illasera (and her flunkies) to match the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS </acronym> norm. Hopefully this makes them more rather than less dangerous (although Ascension <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is pretty good, so I'd welcome feedback).
<p>This component has no effect on the non-Ascension version of Illasera (who is a standard fighter/mage and gets modified by the "Smarter Mages" component). Both the original and the finale versions are affected.
  <p><strong>Smarter Yaga-Shura (BG2, BG2EE, BGT - requires Ascension)</strong></p>
This component changes the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the Ascension version of Yaga-Shura (and his flunkies) to match the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> norm. Hopefully this makes them more rather than less dangerous (although Ascension <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is pretty good, so I'd welcome feedback). Both the original and the finale versions are affected.
<p>This component has no effect on the non-Ascension version of Yaga-Shura (who is a standard fighter and gets modified by the "Smarter General <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>" component).
<p><strong>Smarter Abazigal (BG2, BG2EE, BGT - requires Ascension)</strong></p>
This component tries to upgrade the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of Abazigal. 
Both his humanoid and dragon forms are affected; if you have Ascension installed, so is the finale form of Abazigal, and so is his companion Tamah. I try to systematise Abazigal's magical talents a bit, but I don't do anything for which there isn't some existing in-game justification.
  <p><strong>Smarter Gromnir (BG2, BG2EE, BGT - requires Ascension)</strong></p>
This component changes the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the Ascension version of Gromnir Il-Khan (and his flunkies) to match the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> norm. Hopefully this makes them more rather than less dangerous (although Ascension <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is pretty good, so I'd welcome feedback). Both the original and the finale versions are affected.
<p>This component has no effect on the non-Ascension version of Gromnir (who is a standard fighter and gets modified by the "Smarter General <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>" component).

<p><strong>Ascension versions of Irenicus and Sendai use <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> abilities and  <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> (BG2, BG2EE, BGT - requires Ascension)</strong></p>
These components do exactly what they say: they modify these aspects of Ascension to fit the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> norm. (Note that only the chapter 10 version of Sendai is affected: the chapter 9 version will use <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> scripting anyway.)
<p><strong>Ascension demons use<acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> abilities and  <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> (BG2, BG2EE, BGT - requires Ascension)</strong></p>


<h3><a name="tacticalbg1" id="tacticalbg1">Tactical Challenges for BG1</a> </h3>
<p>Though the distinction isn't hard-and-fast, components in this section are less concerned with improving the intelligence of creatures, more concerned with increasing their abilities and numbers. (Though hopefully, creatures remain intelligent and changes remain fairly low-key.)  All components in this section are for TUTU/BGT/BGEE installs.
</p>
 <p><strong>Improved doppelgangers</strong></p>
  <p>The doppelgangers in chapter 5 and later are by and large nothing like powerful
    enough to be an interesting challenge to a Tutu party at that level. This
    component (which has been overhauled for version 22) improves them mostly by systematising up, so that all ordinary Dopplegangers you meet are as powerful as the toughest ordinary Dopplegangers, and similarly for Greater Dopplegangers. It also increases the power and resources of the doppleganger assassins you meet late in chapter 7, giving them access to some spellcasting power.</p>
  <p><strong>Tougher Black Talons and Iron Throne guards</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the Black Talon Elite and (most of) the Iron Throne
    mercenaries to <acronym title="Level 5">L5</acronym> fighters. This doesn't have that much effect on the Black
    Talons (though they are now immune to Sleep); it's quite a substantial boost
    for some of the Iron Throne flunkies.</p>
    <p> <strong>Improved Deployment for Parties of Assassins</strong></p>
  <p> Two groups of assassins (one made up mostly of dwarves and gnomes, one
    made up entirely of amazons) hang out in the vicinity of Gullykin. This component
    removes them from there and makes them proactively hunt the party down instead
    - they'll show up at random times in chapter 3 once the main character hits third level.</p>
    <p>As of version 24, the assassins spawn in the usual random-encounter areas on TUTU and BGEE games, and on BGT games with BGSpawns or BGT-Tweaks spawns. (The old behaviour is fun, but a repeated source of bug reports!) If you want to hold on to the old version, you can force it via the ini file.</p>
  <p><strong>Dark-Side-based kobold upgrade</strong></p>
  <p>This component substantially increases the number of kobolds met, and adds
    some tougher "Guards" and "Chieftains" - the Nashkel Mine becomes less of
    a walkover, especially if "Better calls for help" is also being used. </p>
  <p>As the name suggests, this component is substantially based on a small subcomponent
    of the old "Dark Side of the Sword Coast" mod for <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>. I haven't been able to track anyone down
    from that mod to ask permission (I'm not really sure where to start) - it
    goes without saying that if the authors of that mod would like the component
    removed I'd be happy to oblige.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> this is, surprisingly to me, one of the more controversial components, as it's really a fairly sharp increase in difficulty. If your usual play-style is to go to the Nashkel Mines at first level, you may find it tediously difficult (both because you're too low-level to cope with the kobolds, and because you haven't had a chance to get used to SCS).</p>

  <p><strong>Relocated bounty hunters</strong></p>
  <p>In the original game, a tough group of bounty hunters are waiting pointlessly
    in a locked building in the Docks, with no explanation as to why. This small
    component moves them to somewhere more interesting - see <a 
href="#hunters">here</a> to find
    out where, if you want to spoil the suspense.</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Ulcaster</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves two of the tougher monsters in Ulcaster: Icharyd
    and the Vampiric Wolf. Both are pretty straightforward opponents in Tutu
    (more so than I remember from the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>)
    and this component gives them a fighting chance. Both gain a few more hit
    points and some special powers (the Vampiric Wolf's powers are specific to
    the one in the ruins, they don't apply to all vampiric wolves).</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Balduran's Isle (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>) </strong></p> 
  <p>This component makes a number of changes to the "Balduran's Isle" component
    of Tales of the Sword Coast. A couple of the main fights are made more interesting
    and the dialogue with Kaishas and Mendas is substantially altered. It is
    now possible to seek a significantly less bloody resolution to the island
    voyage. (See <a 
href="#werewolf">here</a> for details.)</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Durlag's Tower (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>) </strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the tactical challenge of a number of the key battles
    in Durlag's Tower. It is designed to be used with the "Smarter Mages" and "Smarter
    Priests" components, though it's playable without them. (See <a
href="#durlag">here</a> for
    details.)</p> 
  <p>At least one of these battles is now actually quite hard, though still perfectly
    doable by a seventh-eighth level party.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Demon Cultists (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>)</strong></p>
  <p>This component ups the capabilities of the demon cultists you meet in <acronym title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym>. (See <a
href="#demon">here</a> for details.)
    It's also pretty difficult for a party that isn't already 7th-8th level -
    be warned.</p>
    <p><strong>Improved Cloakwood druids</strong></p>
    <p>The druids of the cloakwood, even with improved scripting, are a pushover for a well-played party. This component increases
    their levels slightly and gives each a couple of low-level acolytes.
    <p><strong>Improved Bassilus</strong></p>
    <p>This component slightly increases Bassilus's level; it also makes his undead flunkies die off a little less quickly even if
    you say the right thing to him.
    <p><strong>Improved Drasus party</strong></p>
    <p>This component upgrades the group of mercenaries you meet in chapter 4 guarding the Cloakwood mines: each gains a couple of levels.
    <p><strong>Improved Red Wizards</strong></p>
    <p>This component adds three levels to each of the Red Wizards of Thay you can meet in the Wood of Sharp Teeth.
    <p><strong>Improved Undercity assassins</strong></p>
    <p>This component enhances the (optional) final group of assassins you meet - each gains about three levels.
  <p><strong>Tougher end-of-chapter battles</strong></p>
  <p>These components (there are four of them) improve the strength and numbers
    of the opposition in the end battles in chapters 2-5 - they are "upgraded" rather
    than massively overhauled, so they still aren't ridiculously hard. See <a
href="#chapterbattles">here</a> for
    details. (There isn't currently a version for chapter 6 - I was dissatisfied with my previous one but haven't had a chance to put something new together.)</p>
  <p><strong>Improved final battle (requires <acronym
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>)</strong></p>
  <p>By the end of the Tutu version of <acronym
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym>, the final battle of <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> isn't much of a challenge. This component
    tries to change that and provide a worthier finale to the adventure. It turns
    out that Sarevok didn't just flee to the Temple of Bhaal because it looked
    pretty - he has other surprises... (see <a
href="#sarevok">here</a> for
    details). </p>
  <p><strong>Improved miscellaneous encounters</strong></p>
  <p>This component mildly increases the difficulty of a half-dozen or so battles
    scattered through the game, usually by increasing opponents' levels by one
    or two. It creates "divertingly" difficult fights
    rather than really stiff challenges. See <a
href="#misc">here</a> for the
    specific battles if you want to spoil the surprise!</p> 

<h3><a name="tacticalbg2" id="tacticalbg2">Tactical Challenges for BG2 </a></h3>
<p>Though the distinction isn't hard-and-fast, components in this section are less concerned with improving the intelligence of creatures, more concerned with increasing their abilities and numbers. (Though hopefully, creatures remain intelligent and changes remain fairly low-key.) All components in this section are for BG2, BG2EE, BGT installs.
</p>


  <p><strong>Make the starting dungeon slightly harder</strong></p>
  <p>This is a very low-key modification to the initial dungeon. It replaces the pathetic goblins with duergar (which I think has a better "feel" to
  it in any case) and it prevents you from sleeping more than once. (I allow you to sleep once because (i) it gives you a chance to choose your spells, and
  (ii) Imoen has some rest-related dialogue that I don't want to block.)</p>


  <p><strong>Improved Shade Lord</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the Shade Lord, mostly by giving him additional
    magical powers (though his hit points are also increased). Unlike most <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    </acronym> components, this one doesn't make any particular effort to stick
    with the vanilla game or with anything from <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> source
    material: like the Wolf of Ulcaster, the Shade Lord has his own unique abilities.</p> 



  <p><strong>Spellcasting Demiliches</strong></p> 
  <p> This component (which requires "smarter mages") makes demiliches more like
    their third-edition versions. The demilich Imprisonment ability has been
    nerfed: it now grants a saving throw vs. death at -5, although it also causes
    level drain even on a successful save.  Demiliches are still 100% immune to
    magic, but they are not additionally immune to spells of L6 or above (this
    means that high-level antimagic works on them). </p>
  <p>On the other hand, demiliches are now by-the-book 35th level wizards with
    significantly accelerated casting times (and the ability to use their Imprisonment ability in the same round that they cast a spell). (Only the demilich in <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> has
    access to <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s.) The net effect
    should be to make demiliches quite significantly more dangerous. </p>

  <p><strong>More Resilient Trolls</strong></p>
  <p>This component tries to turn trolls' regeneration from a minor book-keeping
    nuisance to a genuine threat. Trolls still collapse when reduced close to
    death, and still require fire or acid to finish them off - but a more significant
    amount of damage is needed (ranging from 2 hit points for ice trolls to 8
    hit points for spirit trolls) and they will get up again (at partial strength
    only) much more quickly.</p> 
  <p>This component probably isn't for everyone. Some will find it tactically
    and role-playing-ly interesting; others will find it a chore.</p> 

   <p><strong>Increase difficulty of level-dependent monster groupings</strong></p>
  <p>At various points in the unmodded game, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> chooses
    the strength of the monsters you face based on your level. Typically there
    are four encounters, and which one you get depends on your experience level. </p>
  <p>This component causes the game to give you somewhat tougher choices; there
    are four options available. &quot;Mildly increased difficulty&quot; causes
    you to get a fight one step too high-level for you; &quot;significantly increased
    difficulty&quot; gives you a fight two steps too high, and &quot;almost-maximum
    difficulty&quot; gives you the hardest possible fight whatever your level
    (with one exception: see below). Other ability-dependent components are modified
    in a similar way to try to achieve the same effects.</p> 
  <p> The only exception to the general rule is the "spawn-undead" script, whose
    highest-level setting causes liches to spawn. <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> liches are so much more powerful than vanilla ones that it is
    nearly suicidal to take them on at lower levels (at least without cheesy
    tactics), so even on the "almost-maximum difficulty" setting they don't spawn
    unless you have at least 1 million XP. If you really, really want a massively-hard-to-injure
    undead archmage dumping Pit Fiends and Horrid Wiltings on you at 8th level,
    install the fourth option, "maximum difficulty". </p> 
  <p>This component is rather like the "always tougher spawns" component of Tactics,
    but it's rather more customisable (and, since modding tools are much improved
    since Tactics was written, it installs in a way that's less likely to mess
    up other mods). </p> 

  <p><strong>Improved Random Encounters</strong></p> 
  <p>This component adds a little more variety and challenge to the "You have
    been waylaid by enemies" encounters. The main point of this component was
    not so much to make random encounters more difficult (though it does that
    too, to some extent) as to make them less repetitive - there are now about
    a dozen encounters, and the order in which they occur is somewhat randomised.</p> 


  <p><strong>Improved D'Arnise Keep</strong></p> 
  <p>This component, though not identical to the "Tougher Torgal" component of
    Tactics, is strongly influenced by it. It adds more trolls to the keep, upgrades
    Torgal a bit, and gives Spirit trolls some optional magical abilities. The main differences
    from the Tactics version are more detailed targeting for the spirit trolls,
    a wider variety of troll reinforcements (not just spirit trolls) and a (hopefully!)
    cleverer, but slightly less tough, Torgal (who, in this version, has not
    stolen one of the flail heads). </p>
  <p><strong>Improved Unseeing Eye</strong></p>
  <p>The original Unseeing Eye is actually a fairly ineffectual high-level spellcaster. This component shifts it into an Elder Orb (I assume that, just as the Eye grants
  magical sight to its blind followers, so it grants itself the magical use of its eyestalks even though strictly it's blind; I do assume its central eye is inoperative, though) and makes it virtually immune to damage (Demilich-level immunities)
  until the Rift device is used. Even once the device is used, the Eye will still put up a reasonable fight.</p>

  <p><strong>Improved Bodhi (Tactics remix)</strong></p>
  <p>This component is very closely based on the Improved Bodhi in Westley Weimer's
    Tactics mod. To quote from the readme to that mod: </p>
  <p><em>Sigh. Bodhi is worth 91K <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> --
      more than almost anything else in the game. And yet she is a mere brute-force
      melee fighter who doesn't even drink healing potions. We make her more
      intelligent ... and give her some impressive pseudo-magical powers associated
      with vampires of myth and legend. Bodhi gains dominion over bats, the cold,
      the ground and the grave.</em> </p>
  <p>The <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> version
    of Improved Bodhi is updated to use modern <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> coding
    (to help with compatibility-friendliness) and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripting.
    She comes in two versions: a "hardcore" version which has the same stats
    and powers as Westley's version, and a toned-down version with stats closer
    to Bodhi's vanilla-game stats, less ferocious saving-throw penalties for
    her spells (-4 instead of -10) and no Deathly Shroud (Bodhi's lethal Fire
    Shield power). </p>
  <p>You can fight Bodhi in chapters 3 and 6; in chapter 3 (again, following
    Tactics) she'll pull her punches, slightly more so in the toned-down version
    than the hardcore one.</p>


  <p> <strong>Party's items are taken from them in Spellhold</strong></p>
  This component does essentially what it says: when the party are captured in
  chapter 4, their equipment is taken from them and they have to survive the
  maze beneath Spellhold without it. (They have an opportunity to reclaim it
  before the final battle of chapter 4). A small amount of nonmagical equipment is available relatively
    quickly in the Asylum. Players (even solo players) might want to note that
    Imoen does carry the Enchanted Weapon spell. </p>
  <p> This component is rather similar to a component of the "Big Picture" mod,
    but it's coded rather differently: most importantly, it creates a dynamic
    list of all the items in the game, which should prevent the "missing-item" bugs
    that caused some problems with the Big Picture component. It's compatible
    with the Big Picture version in the following sense: if you install the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> version after the <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> version, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> dynamic-item-generation will be added to the <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> version
    but that version will otherwise be left alone. Don't install the <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> version
    after the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> version, though. </p>
  <p> <strong>Improved fight with Irenicus in Spellhold</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the clones summoned by Irenicus in the end-of-chapter-4 battle (see the Spoilers for details).</p>

  <p><strong>Improved Sahuagin</strong></p>
This component improves all sahuagin in the game (but especially the ones in the sunken city). No new creatures are added, and no special powers are granted, but the sahuagin statistics are systematised and generally improved slightly, and their scripting is smarter. (Various clues in the vanilla game suggest that sahuagin priestesses are cleric/mages; I disregard this and treat them as standard clerics.)
<p>Overall, this component should be a bit more difficult than the vanilla sahuagin, but nothing like as powerful as Tactics' Improved Sahuagin.
 
  <p><strong>Improved beholder hive</strong></p>
This component (adapted from Quest Pack) adds a few extra beholders to the hive in the Underdark, notably including a Hive Mother.

<p><strong>Prevent resting in the illithid city</strong></p>
This component does just what it says it does: it prevents you from sleeping in the city. This is partly on role-playing grounds (it's blatantly implausible that you could rest there), partly on tactical grounds (a party at the kind of level that's likely to enter the city can protect everyone with Chaotic Commands, nullifying most illithid powers. This will force you to ration your protections a bit, and to be more creative.</p>
<p><strong>Slightly Improved Drow</strong></p>
This component makes a number of small improvements to the drow of chapter 5 (it doesn't affect the drow of Sendai's enclave). It slightly increases the combat proficiency of drow soldiers, it adds a few extra drow to one of the Underdark ambushes and a few extra priests to the Ghaunadans; it improves the drow battlegroup defending the doors to the Underdark; it slightly optimises House Jae'llat nobles and adds one more noble and a few commoner priests and mages.
<p>Notably, it also <b>dramatically</b> beefs up the defences of Ust Natha (as of version 8, this is an optional subcomponent). The place is a drow <b>city</b>, not the kind of place that even a 15th level adventuring party should be able to wipe out. Now, more defenders will continuously spawn.  For the first twenty rounds or so, this will be disorganised, low-level groups. After that, the drow will get more organised and start sending serious war-parties against the party. Eventually truly powerful groups of mages and high priestesses will turn up.
<p>
<b>Warning</b>: this component is <b>not</b> intended to make the conquest of the drow city somewhat more interesting and challenging: it is meant to make it virtually impossible. It's probably <b>possible</b> to beat the drow and conquer Ust Natha without exploits, but it will be extremely difficult. The sane thing to do is to get out as soon as you can; even that will probably be a bit trickier than usual.</p>
<p>Players who do want a challenging but doable battle to conquer Ust Natha can make it more manageable at the console; see the Customisation section for details. </p>

<p><strong>Improved Watcher's Keep</strong></p>
This component makes small changes to a few areas in Watcher's Keep to make them more tactically interesting.  The changes  aren't too dramatic; they shouldn't change the feel of the place much. See the spoilers section for details.


  <p><strong>Improved Fire Giant Temple</strong></p>
  This component improves various aspects of the Yaga-Shura part of chapter 8.
  Fire giants acquire some high-level abilities; elemental creatures are slightly
  improved and given better scripts; a couple of bonus monsters are added.

  <p><strong>Improved Sendai's Enclave</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves a number of sections of the approach to Sendai.
    Drow spellcasters become slightly higher-level and can summon more dangerous
    allies; the drow war-parties are tougher and reinforced by other creatures;
    the illithid ambush is less of a joke. Also, the final battle with Sendai
    is modified: no actual creature in the battle is altered at all (though other
    components of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS
    II</acronym> will alter them) but the statues activate and attack in a more
    efficient fashion. </p> 

  <p><strong>Improved Abazigal's Lair</strong></p>
  This component (which has been drastically changed in version 6) improves some parts of Abazigal's lair by adding several new encounters and
  toughening up the existing ones. See the spoilers for details.


  <p><strong>Improved minor encounters</strong></p> 
  <p>This component slightly improves the difficulty of a small number of encounters
    scattered across the game (see spoilers for details).</p> 

 </div>
<h2> <a name="console" id="console">Customisation options (contains spoilers)</a> </h2>
<div class="section">
A significant amount of "fine tuning" of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> is available over and above your install options. There are three ways to do this: the console, the ini file, and override files. The first is done during play after installing; the other two must be done before installing.</p>
<p>Note that just because I make the option available, that doesn't mean I recommend using it! All this section is "at own risk" to a greater or lesser degree.</p>
<h3>The console</h3>
The console can be accessed by (1) adding the line "Cheats=1" (without the quote marks) to the baldur.ini file in your game directory, just below the line "[Game Options]", and then (2) pressing CTRL-SPACE in-game.
<p>
The options are all controlled by setting certain global variables, which is done by typing this command:
<p>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("[Global to set]","GLOBAL",[value to set it to])
<p>
So for instance, to set the variable SeduceBodhi to 3, type
<p>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("SeduceBodhi","GLOBAL",3).
<p>
The variables that can be set in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> are these (all start as 0):
<ul>
<li>DMWWImprisonPlayer - set to 1 if you want enemy spellcasters to try using Imprisonment on your main character (which, be warned, ends the game if they succeed).
<li>DMWWBeholderDisintegrate - set to 1 if you want beholders to use their Disintegrate eyestalk. 
<li>DMWWBeholderDisintegrateSR - set to 1 if you are using Spell Revisions and you want beholders <b>not</b> to use their Disintegrate eyestalk.
<li>DMWWDisableBeholderTheft - set to 1 if you want to prevent beholders trying to steal certain items with their telekinesis eyestalk
<li>DMWWReduceDemonSummoning - set to 1 if you don't want enemy wizards summoning Glabrezus
<li>DMWWDisableBuffing - set to 1 to stop mages and priests doing any pre-battle spellcasting. (Obviously, if you want this switched off all the time then just don't install the prebuffing component; this is to turn it off for any specific fights that you don't feel should have prebuffing. Don't forget to turn it on again.)
<li>DMWWNeutralPrebuff - set to 1 to allow neutral mages and priests to have long-term defences like Stoneskin in place, rather than insta-casting them when they go 
hostile. (Arguably this is more realistic, but it can be offputting.) Note that the default behaviour has been reversed as of version 10.
<li>DMWWDrowCityLite - set to 1 or 2 (in decreasing order of difficulty) to make the defenders of Ust Natha less overwhelming. (See the Drow section in "additional notes on contact" for details, but roughly, each reduces the number of ordinary drow by about 3/4 and halves the number of elite drow.)
<li>DMWWDemorgorgonTS - set to 1 if you want to enable Demogorgon's Time Stop power.
<li>DMWWDemogorgonHost - set to 1 if you want Demogorgon to summon a host of demons at the start of the fight.
<li>DMWWNoTimestopMelee - set to 1 if you want to prevent enemy fighter-mages from attacking during Timestop spells (this mostly affects Irenicus in Hell). Set to 2 if
you additionally want to prevent (the SCS version of) Melissan attacking during Timestops. (This will also prevent Melissan attacking during *your* timestops, and is
pretty exploitable.)
<li>DMWWBonusMerchantSpawn - set to 3 if you're bored of waiting for Joluv and Deirdre to show up.
<li>DMWWNoSkeletonDetonate - set to 1 if you don't want illithids' psionic detonation to destroy skeletons.
<li>DMWWDisintegratePlayer - set to 1 if you want SR mages to use Disintegrate on Player 1, to 2 if you want them to use Disintegrate Spell Triggers on Player 1.
<li>DMWWKillAndris - set to 1 while in the Ice Island Maze to kill Andris. (This is in response to persistent problems with his being unkillable - hopefully I've fixed it, but just in case...)</li>
<li>DMWWIllithidsAreVisible - set to 1 if you want Illithids to avoid automatically going invisible even when the player isn't in sight of them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The ini file</h3>
<p>The file "stratagems.ini", found in the stratagems directory, allows fine-tuning of install options not available via the main installer. To do this, just edit the file in Notepad or another text editor. Each line consists of a configuration option, then a space, then a number. The only thing you should edit is the number.</p>
<p>The current player-usable options are listed below. (Don't change anything not listed; these are work-in-progress and/or part of the testing framework.) I list the default value in parentheses after the setting.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI_Detects_Items_Slowly (1) - set this to zero and enemies will immediately recognise your protective magical items. (Currently it takes about a round.) This may decrease in-game lag.</li>
<li>AI_Does_Not_Detect_Items (0) - set this to 1 and enemies will completely fail to notice your protective magical items. (This is likely to cause some odd behaviour.)
<li>Do_Not_Fix_Save_Errors (0) - set this to 1 and errors in the saving throws for creatures will not be corrected. (At present, inappropriately weak saving throws are automatically fixed.)</li>
<li>Do_Not_Fix_THAC0_Errors (0) - set this to 1 and errors in the attack rolls for creatures will not be corrected. (At present, inappropriately weak attack rolls are automatically fixed.)</li>
<li>Genai_Does_Not_Adjust_Kits(0) - set this to 1 and the "smarter AI" component will not adjust the kits of creatures, nor enforce legal kits on kitted creatures.</li>
<li>Genai_Does_Not_Adjust_Levels(0) - set this to 1 and the "smarter AI" component will not adjust the levels of creatures.</li>
<li>Genai_Does_Not_Adjust_Profs(0) - set this to 1 and the "smarter AI" component will use creatures' original weapon proficiencies rather than rewriting them.</li>
<li>Conceal_Prebuff_Spell_Names(0) - set this to 1 if you don't want pre-buffing wizards and priests to display strings like "Stoneskin (cast previously)" when their buffs go up.
<li>Force_No_HLA_Repeats(0) - set this to 1 if you have a mod (like Vilkacis') installed that allows wizards and priests to learn HLAs as if they were innate abilities rather than spells, and you
don't want enemy wizards and priests to take more than one of each ability. (If you're planning on taking more than one of each yourself, be ashamed.)<li>Mage_Level_Add(0) - this value (which can be positive or negative) is added to the level of all mages in the game (subject to a minimum level of 1 and a maximum of 40).
<li>Mage_Level_Scale(100) - this value (which must be a positive integer) is applied as a percentage scale to the level of all mages in the game
(subject to a minimum level of 1 and a maximum of 40). So if you set it to 125, all mages will be 25 percent higher level than in the baseline install. Mage_Level_Scale is evaluated before Mage_Level_Add.
<li>Priest_Level_Add, Priest_Level_Scale - as above, but for priests
<li>No_Deployment_Change(0) - set to 1 to bypass the changes in (BG1) deployment made by the "Smarter general AI" component. (This reverts to the setup where creatures stand around waiting to be attacked, or come up to you to talk to you before attacking.)
<li>No_Cursed_Golem_Wounds(0) - set to 1 to bypass the cursed wounds caused by Clay Golems.
<li>Bypass_Dragon_Immunity_Changes(0) - set to 1 to prevent "Smarter Dragons" systematising the various immunities available to dragons.
<li>Spellhold_Hardcore(0) - set to 1 to remove the small bag of nonmagical gear that you would otherwise find early in your escape from Spellhold (if you have "party items are removed" installed).
<li>Spellhold_Easycore(0) - set to 1 to get access to your stolen items (in "party items are removed") before the final confrontation with Irenicus. (This mildly tangles up the plot.)
<li>Fiends_Cast_Slowly(0) - set to 1 to have fiends cast spells like normal casters. (This may confuse fiend AI to some extent.)
<li>Dragons_Cast_Slowly(0), Genies_Cast_Slowly(0), Celestials_Cast_Slowly(0) - as for "Fiends_Cast_Slowly".
<li>Fiend_Staying_Power(150) - this is the actual percentage multiplier for the hit points of fiends if you install the "increased fiend hit points" subcomponent.
<li>Dragon_Staying_Power(300), Celestial_Staying_Power(150), Genie_Staying_Power(150) - as for "Fiend_Staying_Power".
<li>Sendai_Component_Is_Sendai_Only(0) - this is a favour to Loz. If set to 1, the Sendai's Enclave component only enhances the final encounter with Sendai.
<li>thac0_tolerance(6) - this controls how much a creature's thac0 can be better than its legal level for SCS to assume it ought to be corrected, rather than left in place as deliberate. Set it to zero to disable SCS's correction of too-good thac0. Set it to 99 to ensure that all thac0s are made legal. (Only weapon-using creatures are affected.)
<li>Force_Old_Assassin_Spawn(0) - if set to 1, the C3 assassins spawn in the old (pre v24) fashion.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Override files</h3>
<p>In many cases, choices of spells, kits, creature levels and the like are externalised to text files which are then user-editable using Notepad or similar. <b>You do this at your own risk.</b> Here is a list of the files that can be edited. In each case the file format is fairly self-explanatory (though you may need to look up the resource names of creatures from Near Infinity).
<ul>
<li><b>High-level Abilities for fighters and thieves</b>
<ul>
<li><em>genai/hla_choices/core.2da</em>: default choices of High-Level Abilities for fighters and thieves. (Powers are chosen at random; if a power has a prerequisite that isn't possessed, that prerequisite is granted instead.)
<li><em>genai/hla_choices/refinements.2da</em>: used instead of core.2da if Refinements is installed.
<li><em>genai/hla_choices/override_fighter.2da,  genai/hla_choices/override_thief.2da</em>: used to override the default choices for specific creatures.
</ul>
<li><b>Kits for fighters and thieves</b>
<ul> 
<li><em>genai/kit_override/bg2/[kit].2da</em> - assigns kits to bg2 characters. Just list the creature resource name in the appropriately-named file.
<li><em>genai/kit_override/bg1/[kit].2da</em> - same for bg1 characters. Creatures should be listed in non-TUTU form, i.e. without the initial "_". Missing files present in the BG2 version can be added.
</ul>
<li><b>Levels for fighters and thieves</b>
<ul>
<li><em>genai/level_override/bg1.2da</em>: overrides levels for BG1 fighters/thieves. Creatures should be listed in non-TUTU form, i.e. without the initial "_".
<li><em>genai/level_override/bg2.2da</em>: overrides levels for BG2 fighters/thieves.
</ul>
<li><b>Choices of non-defensive spells for mages</b>
<ul>
<li><em>mage/spellchoices/core/[type].2da</em> (where "type" is "necromancer", "conjurer", "invoker", "enchanter", "fighter-mage" or "bard"): the standard spells used by mages at each level (after the basic allocation of protective and utility spells has been made). Spells are chosen at random from each level. The "H" row is used for HLAs if they are cast as normal spells, the "IO" row if they are cast as non-reusable innates, and the "IR" row if they are repeatable innates. (Note that adding a spell not on the list at all probably will not lead to anything useful, since the mage will not cast that spell.)
<li><em>mage/spellchoices/demivrgvs/[type].2da</em>: as above, but this version is used if Demivrgvs' "Spell Revisions" mod is installed.
<li><em>mage/spellchoices/refinements/[type].2da</em>: as above, but this version is used for HLAs if the "Refinements" is installed.
<li>(Defensive spells are controlled from the "defensive_spells_[type].tph" files in the mage directory, but this is code, not data, so only touch it if you really know what you are doing.)
</ul>
<li><b>Choices of non-defensive spells for priests</b>: as mage, with the obvious replacement of "mage" with "priest". (Possible types are "cleric_good", "cleric_neutral", "cleric_evil", "druid", and "avenger".)
<li><b>Choices of kits, levels, alignment and individual spells for specific mages and priests:</b> controlled by <em>[mage/priest]/override/[bg1/bg2]/[alignment/kit/level/spellchoice].2da</em>. The format should be self-explanatory.
<li><b>Choices of which mages and priests get HLAs</b>
<ul>
<li><em>[mage/priest]/hla/tob_spec.2da</em>: controls which "special casters in ToB" get HLAs
<li><em>[mage/priest]/hla/tob_norm.2da</em>: controls which "normal casters in ToB" get HLAs
<li><em>[mage/priest]/hla/soa_spec.2da</em>: controls which "normal casters in SoA" get HLAs
</ul>
</ul>

<div class="section"> 
<p><strong><a name="healing" id="healing"></a>Re-introduce potions of extra-healing.</strong></p>
<p>
There are three potions at the temple in the Friendly Arm Inn, five each at the Song of the Morning temple at Beregost and the 
Lady's temple in Baldur's Gate, and eight at the High Hall of Wonders in Baldur's Gate.
<p><strong><a name="scrolls" id="scrolls"></a>Standardise spells between <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></strong></p>
<p>The locations of the new spells are as follows.
<ul>
<li>Feldepost's Inn: Reflected Image, Spook, Deafness
<li>High Hedge: Spook, Power Word: Sleep, Ray of Enfeeblement, Deafness, Minor Spell Deflection, Protection from Fire, Protection from Cold, Hold Undead
<li>Sorcerous Sundries: Power Word: Sleep, Ray of Enfeeblement, Minor Spell Deflection, Protection from Fire, Protection from Cold, Hold Undead, Melf's
Minute Meteors, Contagion, Secret Word, Farsight, Wizard Eye

<li>Dezkiel: Stoneskin
<li>Halacan: Detect Illusion
<li>Kysus: Fire Shield: Red
<li>Niemain: Spider Spawn

<li>Resar: Fire Shield: Blue
<li>Tranzig: Glitterdust
<li>Venkt: Spell Thrust
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="npc" id="npc"></a>Move NPCs to more convenient locations.</strong></p>
<p>
The NPCs who are moved are:
<ul>
<li>Eldoth - moves from the Cloakwood to the woods south of the Friendly Arm.
<li>Quayle - moves from Baldur's Gate to the Nashkel Carnival
<li>Shar-Teel - moves from a fairly inaccessible bit of wilderness to the Nashkel-Beregost road
<li>Tiax - moves from Baldur's Gate to Beregost
<li>Viconia - moves from the eastern forest to the woods south of Beregost.
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="bounty" id="bounty"></a>Relocated bounty hunters.</strong></p>
<p>
These are the five ogre magi in the Docks district. They turn up just outside Candlekeep as you arrive at the start of chapter six.
<p><strong><a name="werewolf" id="werewolf"></a>Improved Balduran's Isle.</strong></p>
<p>Three fights are modified:
<ul>
<li>The battle with Karoug. Karoug himself is left alone, but Daese lives up to the villagers' warning about the wolfweres' magical powers. She becomes an eighth-level mage.
<li>The confrontation with Kaishas. Kaishas becomes a greater werewolf, with Free Action and immunity to all weapons except cold iron. (This seems to have been intended in BG1 but not properly implemented). She will also call for help from the tunnels: reinforcements will arrive at a rate of about one werewolf per round.
<li>The final battle with Selaad. Selaad and Baresh are now both greater werewolves, as well as being respectable opponents in human form - Baresh is a twelfth-level fighter, Selaad is a tenth-level mage. Only once reduced to below 25% hit points will they take on their wolfman forms.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, it is now possible to talk your way past Kaishas and on to the boat. Your protagonist needs either Intelligence 14+, or Wisdom 14+ and good alignment, and you need to have saved Maralee's baby and befriended Durlayle or Delainy. (This was an aspect of the original game that's always infuriated me - I <em>liked</em> Kaishas.)

<p><strong><a name="durlag" id="durlag"></a>Improved Durlag's Tower.</strong></p>
<p>
Four fights are modified:
<ul>
<li>The battle with "Love", "Pride", "Avarice", and "Fear" on the first dungeon level. They get extra hit points and/or regenerative capability, and three get improved magic powers.
<li>The doppelgangers on the second dungeon level - they are instructed to use their specific powers a bit more effectively. (This mostly affects Islanne's doppelgangers; it won't be all that effective without Smarter Mages).
<li>The duplicates that can emerge from the Mirror have been upgraded slightly.
<li>The chessboard battle has been significantly upgraded and is now quite difficult. The chess constructs have gained a variety of immunities (electricity, normal weapons, mind-affecting magic) to represent their status as constructs rather than humans; the pawns have gained more hit points. The King is now a 9th/7th level fighter/mage and the Queen is an 11th level mage. 
<br>(For what it's worth, my own solution to the fight was to refuse to play the chessboard game: make everyone immune to lightning and just go where you want. You should have enough potions of absorption by this stage.)
</ul>
 <p><strong><a name="demon" id="demon"></a>Improved demon cult.</strong></p>
<p>
The cult consists of:
<ul>
<li>Cult Guards: 8th level fighters. Their hit points are increased from 39 to 65; otherwise they're left alone. <em>But</em> note that 8th level fighters usually get pretty good battle potions from Smarter Potions.
<li>Cult Archers: originally 8th level thief archers, they're changed into 8th level fighters (more hit points and better battle potions).
<li>Cult Assassins: 8th level fighter/thieves. They get extra hit points and a stack of Invisibility potions (they'll only use them if you have Improved General AI installed).
<li>Cult Wizards: originally 3rd level wizards (in practice), they become 8th level and get Wands of Paralysis (a surprisingly nasty weapon in BG1).
<li>Cult Enforcers: in the original game they're actually listed as high-level fighter-mages, but they don't use any of their fighter-mage powers. I take their classification seriously: they are now 15th/15th level fighter-mages, though with only L5 spells and below, and they use their Wands of Frost. These guys are very dangerous.
</ul>
The demon Aec'Letec isn't modified (it's already seriously dangerous) but Tracea Carrol, previously a weakling wizard (c. L6), is now 11th level. In addition, the six cultists from whom Aec'Letec draws strength will now defend themselves. All in all, this makes the final battle with Aec'Letec pretty tough. I recommend the use of Arrows of Dispelling on your own party to dispel Aec'Letec's Death Gaze.
 <p><strong><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>Improved miscellaneous encounters.</strong></p>
 The full list is:
<ul>
<li>Laurel the paladin's gibberling hunt. As it stands this is a ridiculous encounter - the "horde" of gibberlings is tiny. I've quadrupled their number - it's still not a difficult fight, but it's a more realistic one.
<li>Cythandria, Sarevok's paramour, is currently guarded by a pair of hopeless ogres; they're replaced by Stone Golems.
<li>Slythe the assassin gains a level (which brings his backstab into quadruple-damage territory). He also slugs a potion of invulnerability, and receives a Non-Detection spell, before the battle starts.
<li>Jenkal, the halfling traitor in Gullykin, is currently a 4/4 fighter/thief. I raise her to 6/6 and give her some potions of invisibility. Jenkal will flee if badly hurt and will turn up again later in the game. More seriously, the secret passage in Jenkal's home is now blocked, requiring you to go the long way through Firewine Bridge to reach the Ogre Mage.
<li>Hairtooth and Gnarl, the half-ogres at the bridge to the gnoll fortress, become 5th level fighters and get an appropriate (18/95) strength score.
<li>Sunin (the randomly encountered mage in a house in Baldur's Gate) is raised to 11th level.
<li>Tamoko's level is increased to 14, so she's slightly more of a speed bump to end-of-game-level parties.
<li>The "amazon" group of assassins gain one level each. (This is really just to make them immune to Sleep.)
</ul>
<a name="chapterbattle" id="chapterbattle"></a>
<p><strong>Tougher chapter-two end battle</p></strong>

<p>
This is the fight with Mulahey at the bottom of the Nashkel Mine.<p>
Mulahey's hit points are improved, and he gets some Strength of One spells and scripting to use them. Mulahey's tough kobold allies are redesignated as "Kobold Elites" and improved a bit. The allies that he summons later in the fight are beefed up a bit too.
<p>If "Dark Side based kobold upgrade" is installed, the kobold elites get poisoned daggers and the summoned allies include some kobold guards.

<p><strong>Tougher chapter-three end battle</p></strong>


<p>
This is the fight with the Iron Throne adventurers in Tazok's tent.<p>
Britik the gnoll gets a strength potion and a slight level increase. A few Black Talons and Chill are added to the tent.
<p>Most importantly, if you talked your way into the bandit camp, by the time you get out you'll find that Taugosz has smelled a rat, and you may have
to fight your way out. And if you storm the camp, the Iron Throne adventurers won't be content to wait for you - they'll come out and attack.
<p>

<p><strong>Tougher chapter-four end battle</p></strong>


<p>
The confrontation with Davaeorn at the bottom of the Cloakwood mine. 
<p>The battle horrors, instead of being summoned by traps, are there already. They're enchanted to be immune to fire, lightning and web (I'm following pen-and-paper rules here, more or less.)
<p>More importantly, <em>if</em> the Smarter Mages component is installed, Davaeorn benefits from it: he has a modified script which combines features of his original teleport-around script with the Smarter Mages script.

<p><strong>Tougher chapter-five end battle</p></strong>


<p>
The six acolytes are left alone (though if you are using the Smarter Mages/Priests/general AI components you'll notice a big effect). However, they are joined by two new acolytes: a half-elven fighter/thief and a human thief, who begin the battle invisible. You get some warning of the change if you read the dialogues lower down the tower carefully.

<p>
Sarevok and his three acolytes (Tazok, Angelo, Semaj) are joined by a fourth: Diarmid, who the party briefly encounter at the very end of chapter 6. He's a fighter/mage rather like Angelo.
<p>
More crucially, Sarevok is the beneficiary of a spell which lets him draw protective strength from his followers. You won't even be able to hurt him until at least one is dead, and killing him requires all four to have died. (Not terribly original, I admit, but in the original battle you might as well just ignore everyone else and go straight for Sarevok. This way it's a proper fight against a <em>team</em> of opponents. And hopefully the added dialogue is smooth enough not to make it feel contrived.)

  <p><strong>Move Vhailor's Helm into Throne of Bhaal</strong></p>
  <p>Vhailor's Helm is now worn by Gromnir Il-Khan, who is not afraid to use
    it. (He'll use it whether you're confronting the unmodded or the Ascension
    versions of Gromnir.) </p> 
  <p><strong>Move the Robe of Vecna into Throne of Bhaal</strong></p> 
  <p>The Robe of Vecna is now worn by Azamantes, the lich guardian of the Seal
    of the Imprisoned One. If you install the Smarter Mages component, you will
    find that he has received a memo explaining that the Improved Alacrity spell
    has never been more fun... </p> 
  <p><strong>Move the Cloak of Mirroring into Throne of Bhaal</strong></p> 
  <p>The Cloak of Mirroring is now worn by the demilich of Watcher's Keep. (Don't ask me how a demilich can wear a cloak;
according to 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons, they can benefit from equipment even if they don't wear it.)</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved fiends</strong></p>
  <p>Alu-fiends: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Charm person, at will </li> 
  </ul>
  <p> Balors (cast at 24th level): </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Stoneskin, Fire Storm, Implosion, once per day each. </li> 
    <li>Teleport without Error, Remove Magic, Telekinesis, Symbol: Stun, Symbol:
      Death, and Domination, all at will. </li> 
    <li>Permanently wreathed in flames (Fire Shield effect) </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> Balors will only use their Implosion power in Throne of Bhaal. All Balors
    now wield the vorpal swords that the Watchers' Keep Balors wield; but these
    have been modified so that they kill but don't chunk, and so that they allow
    a saving throw.</p> 
  <p> Bone Fiends (cast at 12th level): </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Teleport without Error, Improved Invisibility, and Cone of Cold, all

    <li>Chain Lightning, Fireball, Cone of Cold, an acidic blob attack based on the acid blob trap, and an airburst attack based on the dragon's Wing Buffet, at will when in the appropriate form.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Demogorgon (cast at 30th level): </p>
  <ul> 
    <li>Initial Chain Contingency, containing Protection from Magic Weapons, Aura of Flaming Death, and Spell Turning.</li>
<li>Initial Contingency, containing Stoneskin.
<li>Stoneskin, once per two rounds </li>
<li>Protection from Magic Weapons, once per six rounds</li> 
<li>Summon demons, once per two rounds; doing so also partially heals him and restores his Magic Resistance
<li>Storm of Vengeance and Dragon's Breath once per day</li> 
<li>Implosion, once per 30 rounds</li>
<li>Earthquake, once per 20 rounds</li>
<li>True Sight, Death Spell, and Unholy Word, each once per six rounds</li>
<li>Finger of Death, Breach and Spell Strike, each once per 3 rounds</li>
<li>Dispel Magic and Teleport without Error, at will</li>
<li>Charm hostile demons, at will</li>
 </ul> 
In addition, Demogorgon has a gaze attack (either a charm or a confusion effect) which he can use each round in addition to his spells. My original version of Demogorgon also had a Time Stop usable once per day (as in Ascension) but I worried that this was too much; if you want to turn this back on, enter SetGlobal("DMWWDemogorgonTS","GLOBAL",1) at the console.
<p><strong>Smarter Beholders</strong></p>
The beholders can now use their telekinesis power to steal the Cloak of Mirroring and the Shield of Balduran. They don't do it in the first couple of rounds, then they have a 1/3 chance per round (per beholder). The idea isn't to make the items useless but to block the move of just giving them to one person and sending them in. If it annoys you, you can turn it off at the console: set DMWWDisableBeholderTheft to 1.</p>

<li>The <b>Dragon of Pride</b>, basically a clone of the Shadow Dragon
<li>The <b>Orb of Fear</b>, a beholder with some initial defensive buffs 
(Blade Barrier, Spell Turning, Fire Shields, Spell Immunity: Abjuration, and Protection from Magic Weapons)
and with its central (antimagic) eye replaced by a ray that reduces Constitution. (The original one instead used randomly selected eyestalk powers 
from a list including basically every beholder-kin power in the game.)
<li>The <b>Wraith of Wrath</b>, a magic-immune warrior whose blows drain 2 points of strength per hit
<li>The <b>Sword of Greed</b>, an ultrapowerful, regenerating version of Mordenkainen's Sword whose blows drain 4 levels per hit and boost the Sword itself
<li> <b>Selfish Jon</b> (not a name used in-game), a version of Irenicus who is a 25th level wizard with immunity to damaging magic and greatly improved casting time, and a new spell - "shatter
magic" which is basically an ultrapowerful dispel. (The original version had permanent Improved Alacrity, but chose spells randomly from a list instead of getting a proper
spell book.)
</ul>
<p>After that, you get an autosave, and (unless you set "DMWWIINoRest" to 1 at the console) everyone gets resurrected and healed. Then you get either the original Tactics 2nd and 3rd round (see that mod for details) or the SCS standard Irenicus battle.
Note that the Dragon, the Orb, and Selfish Jon only get SCS scripting if you've installed the appropriate AI components (otherwise the original version is used).</p>
<p>In the original version, each of the fragments steals an item from you (the Dragon takes the Amulet of Power, the Orb takes the Shield of Balduran, the Wraith takes
Crom Faeyr, the Sword takes Weimer's "Acid Kensai" sword, and Selfish Jon takes the Cloak of Mirroring). I find this a bit unrealistic so it's disabled by default; you can 
re-enable it by setting "DMWWIIStealStuff" to 1 at the console.</p>
<p>Also in the original version, on Insane difficulty the fragments all spawn allies - wraiths for the Wraith, beholders for the Orb, wyverns for the Dragon, Mordenkainen's Swords
for the Sword, and liches for Selfish Jon. I tie this to a variable rather than the difficulty slider: it's off by default, but setting DMWWIISpawn to 2 enables all spawning
and setting it to 1 enables all spawning except for liches.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Watcher's Keep</strong></p>
The statues on level one are rearranged: a fighter becomes a thief, a random monster becomes a high-level mage, and an archer gets a proper archery script. Some random extra fiends are added to the teleport maze as random encounters for when you return to already-cleared areas. The two spellcasting glabrezu gain four brethren. The number of mind flayers in the lair on level four is greatly increased.
<p><strong>Improved Drow</strong></p>
The drow defenders of Ust Natha look like this:
<ul>
<li><b>Group A: disorganised raiders</b> (about every five rounds)
<ul>
<li>Three L9 fighters, two L9 archers, a L12/12 fighter/mage
<li>Two L9 fighters, two L9 archers
<li>Four L9 fighters, two L9 archers, a L10 cleric
<li>Four L9 fighters, a L11 mage
</ul>
<li><b>Group B: serious war-parties</b> (every four rounds)<br>
Each party comprises six L9 fighters, four L9 archers, a L10 cleric, a L14 cleric, a L12/12 fighter/cleric, a L11 mage, and a L15 mage. There are four of these war-parties.
<li><b>Group C: elite battlegroups</b> (every ten rounds, with another Group B war-party between each battlegroup)
<ul>
<li>Four L9 fighters, three L17 mages
<li>Four L9 fighters, two L12/12 fighter/clerics, a L18 cleric, a L18 mage, a glabrezu, and two nabassu
<li>Two L11 mages, a L15 mage, a L22 mage, and four stone golems
<li>Six L9 fighters, two L10 clerics, two L12/12 fighter/clerics, a L14 cleric, a L20 cleric, two balors and two glabrezu.
</ul>
</ul> I will be favourably impressed if anyone beats that lot.
<p>If you want a tough fight but something a little less hideous, set DMWWDrowCityLite to 1 (in which case after group A you'll get two group-B war parties and the third and fourth elite groups) or to 2 (in which case after group A you'll get a group-B war party and the first and second elite groups).

 
  <p><strong>Improved Fire Giant Lair</strong></p> 
  Fire giants gain 2 <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> and
  elites gain 5; both become Berserkers. Flaming Skulls become tougher and get
  access to Stoneskin and more powerful fireballs, and Burning Men get a dispel-magic
  attack; both get a smarter script. One of the groups of fire creatures behind
  the force fields is replaced by a group of Efreeti and a Fire Lich (a creature
  removed from the original game). Imix becomes tougher and gets a Greater Whirlwind
  ability. A red dragon of about Firkraag's strength joins the giants in the
  inner temple.
  <p><strong>Improved Sendai's Enclave</strong></p> 
  <p>Drow mages are raised to 16th level; drow priests are raised to 17th level
    and gain a Gate spell that summons a Balor (summoning Pit Fiends isn't appropriate
    for the chaotic evil drow). The random (and weak) drow spawns in the city
    region of the enclave are replaced by two war parties - one backed up by
    glabrezu, one by beholders. Odamaron gets two apprentices (one vampire, one lich) and two skeleton 	warriors. 
	The pathetic illithid ambush is replaced by two
    battles: one with the vampiric illithids reinforced by three more illithids
    with umber-hulk guards, one with a three-stage illithid strike force consisting
    of human thralls, illithids, and ulitharids supported by umber hulks. Sendai's
    statues animate once per round whether or not the previous one is dead. </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Abazigal's Lair</strong></p> 
  The Earth Elementals are replaced by Lizard Men, as are the Salamanders. A
  strike force of baatezu (two pit fiends, four cornugons) attacks the party
  on their way back from collecting the Breath Potion. All eyes except the eagle
  eyes get better targetting; the sentinels now summon much tougher monsters
  (elementals, mordenkainen's swords, efreeti, and skeleton warriors). A strike
  force of tyrant golems (golem beholders; lots of <acronym title="hit ponts">HP</acronym> and
  100% <acronym title="Magic Resistance">MR</acronym>) and undead beholders protects
  the entrance to Iycanth's sanctum.
<p>More importantly, there are two new encounters with dragons. The bone fiend area where the Breath Potion is has been replaced with the lair of a yellow dragon (and L20-odd mage) who was ousted by Abazigal. You have to fight the dragon one way or another, but depending on how the conversation goes, it may not be to the death. There is a rather nice item available if you play nice, and the dragon's scales if you play nasty.
<p>
Part way through the lair, you'll have to return to town. On coming back, there will be a posse of dragons waiting for you: two black dragons, then a green dragon, and finally a red dragon.
<p>
The dragon encounters have (for a tactical mod) a reasonable amount of dialogue; I welcome feedback on it (and everything else, as usual.)
  <p><strong>Improved minor encounters</strong></p>
  <ul> 
    <li>The Twisted Rune's fighter Revanek gets some equipment (this is almost
      a bugfix) and Vaxall the beholder becomes an Elder Orb. (code borrowed
      from Quest Pack with thanks). </li> 
    <li>The Guarded Compound fighters become, respectively, a berserker and a
      barbarian, and the traps in the compound no longer affect the slavers. </li>
    <li>The Murderers who work with Irenicus are upgraded to 7th level thieves </li>
    <li>A few extra creatures are added to the Druid Grove (code borrowed from
      Tactics with thanks)</li> 
    <li>Imix is now immune to his own traps</li> 
    <li>The Unseeing Eye guards are slightly tougher.</li> 
    <li>The elemental guardians of the Underdark portals are slightly tougher and have some magical abilities and some sidekicks.
    <li>The defenders of the temple of Talos (if you do the good cleric quest) have been upgraded: there are more Storm Knights and a temple mage, and the Knights are now cleric/fighters.
    <li>Nyalee gets a Mirror of Opposition that can make hostile copies of party members. The skeleton warriors in her area get the normal skeleton-warrior resistances.
    <li>The Docks muggers are now thieves (not fighter/thieves) and don't endlessly respawn.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><a name="known" id="known">Known Issues</a> </h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <ul> 
    <li><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> has

<h2><a name="version" id="version">Version History</a></h2> 
<div class="section"> 

<p>Changelogs for versions 1-21 of SCS and SCSII can be found in their respective v21 readmes in the "doc" folder.</p>

<p><h3>Version 22 (February 2013)</h3></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Unified SCS and SCSII into combined version
<li>Complete recoding of the mod from the ground up (desperately needed to make it half-way maintainable after eight years of unplanned development) using a "functional" coding style intended to work at a much higher level of abstraction
<li>Compatibility with the Enhanced Edition of BG
<li>New automated install program
<li>Streamlining of the component structure: some smaller options are now moved out to the .ini file and some components are merged. (I think no actual customisation options have been lost, but the previous structure was a bit forbidding for new users.)
<li>Systematic restructuring of "improved general AI" component to rebuild creatures' choices of proficiency, HLAs, and kit-provided abilities, from scratch
<li>Reorganising of general AI scripts to be more adapted to the particular creature's weapons (this means more scripts, but shorter scripts; hopefully this reduces lag.
<li>Substantial expansion in the number of kitted creatures
<li>Clay golems now cause cursed wounds (a la PnP)
<li>Deprecated "Improved Irenicus in Hell" (I coded it as a favour to someone ages ago, but I don't really feel its flavour meshes with SCS. Squeal if you want it reinstated.)
<li>Deprecated "Improved final battle in [BG1] chapter 6". (I've never really been happy with it.)
<li>Rewrote the Doppleganger component, removing the non-PnP ability boosts and standardising doppleganger abilities.
<li>Too many small tweaks, bugfixes, optimisations and consistency adjustments to keep track of
</ul>
</p>

<p><h3>Version 23 (March 2013)</h3></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a number of BG1 creatures which were L30 in their second level in the vanilla game. (This messes with SCS's algorithms for THAC0 and saving throws.)
<li>Updated French translation (thanks, Mornagest).
<li>Updated Russian translation (thanks, Silent).
<li>Bassilus component now installs on BGEE v2014. (Sorry, modding a game still under development means shooting at a moving target...)
<li>Bears in BGEE no longer have warp drives.
<li>"Fine weapons" component should now work correctly in TUTU.
<li>The "improved minor encounters" component correctly locks Jenkal's door.
<li>Teven's bandits should now go hostile correctly.
<li>The ogres who've incurred Sarhedra's ire should now more reliably register as dead.
<li>On BGEE, Mulahey doesn't spawn a double helping of kobolds.
</ul>
</p>

<p><h3>Version 24 (August 2013)</h3>
<b>New components or major changes</b>
<ul>
<li>"NPCs wait at inns" now works on BGEE.</li>
<li>"Allow NPC pairs to separate" now works on BGEE.</li>
<li>Updated German translation (provided by Leonardo Watson)</li>
<li>Updated Polish translation (provided by Luk S)</li>
</ul>
<b>Minor content tweaks</b>
<ul>
<li>Minor file-structure tidying.</li>
<li>Tweak to the ssl_to_bcs macro so as to allow more standard "location" arguments.</li>
<li>Imix's attacks (in Improved Fire Giants) now count as +5.</li>
<li>If a component fails to install, users are invited to visit the forum, not to email me.</li>
<li>New option for genies: increase hit points by 50%. (This was in the readme but not actually implemented.)</li>
<li>Externalised the level of hit-point increase to genies, dragons, celestials and fiends to stratagems.ini.</li>
<li>"Standardise BG1 spells" now allows for 5th level mage spells: Once copy of each such spell is now available from Sorcerous Sundries. (Suggestions for more imaginative distributions are welcome!)</li>
<li>The spells that summon shapeshifter tokens are now named for the tokens, not the shapeshift itself (hopefully less confusing).</li>
<li>Humanoid creatures with slightly too-good THAC0s now have them trimmed back to legal levels. (I think in most cases in the vanilla game this is done to crudely allow for weapon proficiencies et al. Since I now do that explicitly, there's some double-counting going on. Occasional cases where the THAC0 is radically too good are left alone.)</li>
<li>Minor under-the-hood changes to SFO function library.</li>
<li>Where possible assassins now spawn in random-encounter areas, not on the main maps. (Can be overridden at the ini.)</li>
<li>Credus the bandit no longer initiates dialog if the bandits are all hostile.</li>
<li>Fine-tuned the auto-installer.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>We now use the WEIDU newline and tabulation variables rather than the previous kludge, which should help (at least) Mac installs (thanks to Wisp for suggestion).</li>
<li>Summoned wolves are exempt from the non-hostile wolf component.</li>
<li>The install options for the "remove unrealistic ammunition" component now display correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a typo that displayed a nonexistent string (15046) in some circumstances where a user tried to install a component that required another missing component.</li>
<li>"Improved Sendai's Enclave" now installs correctly even if "Smarter Mages" is not installed (previously fixed in SCSII and un-fixed in v22...)</li>
<li>"SCS scripting for Improved Abazigal" now installs correctly even if "Smarter Mages" is not installed.</li>
<li>"Improved BG1 minor encounters" fix for Jenkal was erroneously being applied to Slythe (caught by Adanedhel).</li>
<li>Davaeorn no longer stands around like a lemon when he's finished his core attack routine.</li>
<li>On Enhanced Edition installs, Shar-Teel's duel with men no longer has odd results (either when picked up, or in the Basilisk area).</li>
<li>If the does_not_detect_items ini flag is checked, ENCHANTMENT_IMMUNITY warnings are no longer displayed.</li>
<li>"Improved Fire Giant" scripts hadn't been properly moved over to the new SCS format.</li>
<li>Red and green dragon scripts in Abazigal's enclave now compile properly.</li>
<li>Avengers now buff correctly.</li>
<li>Synchronised some disparaties in gtimes.ids between different versions of the game, which was messing with script parsing in a couple of places.</li>
<li>Moved shapeshifter token summoning over to 122 from 255, which <b>might</b> prevent random vanishing of tokens.</li>
<li>Increased hit points for fiends should now work correctly.</li>
<li>Sorted minor issues with the Nashkel merchant's winter-wolf pelt quest.</li>
<li>Better Calls for Help now insulates Irenicus's dryads from other creatures.</li>
<li>Bonus Merchant component is no longer broken.</li>
<li>SSL scripts now compile correctly even if "AI_does_not_detect_items" is set to 1.</li>
<li>Mulahey is no longer supported by several hundred kobolds! (A spawn-more-kobold script was erroneously being given to some of his flunkies and then malfunctioning; the script has been removed from the flunkies and also rewritten to be proof against that sort of malfunction.)</li>
<li>Tweaked bandit, and generic help, scripts to hopefully reduce the incidence of creatures homing in on invisible PCs.</li>
<li>Corrected a couple of glitches on the BGT version of "NPCs wait at inns.</li>
<li>Improved chapter 5 battle: the dual-wielding assassin wasn't getting the correct weapons on non-TUTU installs.</li>
<li>Creatures with "wander randomly" instructions (i.e., the old WDASIGHT and WDARSGT) now follow them.</li>
<li>A few mages were sometimes getting illegally many defensive spells.</li>
<li>"Welcome to Candlekeep" message is correctly removed if skip-tutors is installed on BGEE.</li>
<li>On BGEE, "unusable by" information no longer appears twice.</li>
<li>On BGEE, "CHARNAME" is now correctly rendered (at least if you use the auto-installer).</li>
<li>Fixed a find/replace error that was messing up Bassilus's undead.</li>
<li>Fixed a typo that prevented Aec'letec's cultists from defending themselves.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in the vanilla Enhanced Edition shout script.</li>
<li>General AI no longer suppresses monsters' battle-cries. (Thanks to Pecca for spotting this one.)</li>
<li>Consistent Breach now works properly.</li>
<li>Ulcaster component now works properly.</li>
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Creatures with illegally high character levels no longer cause install failures.</li>
<li>"Move NPCs to new locations" now correctly checks if the equivalent BG1NPC component is installed.</li>
<li>Spell Revisions' wizard spell "Create Undead" is now correctly handled by SCS (this previously caused an install failure if SR was installed).</li>
<li>SSL scripts required for Spell Revisions fiends and celestials are now compiled correctly (this also previously caused an install failure if SR was installed).</li>
<li>Since SR no longer modifies the Wand of Spell Striking, neither do we.</li>
<li>SR's "Sunscorch" spell should now be used correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Version 25 (November 2013)</h3>
<b>New components or major changes</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated function library. (You won't notice this in game but it's a significant coding shift.)</li>
<li>Updated to WEIDU 234; associated changes to BGEE installation process.</li>
<li>BG2EE support.</li>
<li>Updated French translation (thanks to Mornagest).</li>
<li>Updated Russian translation (thanks to Silent).</li>
<li>Updated Polish translation (thanks to S Lukasz).</li>
</ul>
<b>Minor content tweaks</b>
<ul>
<li>Incorporated the EE text for Power Word Blind.</li>
<li>Included AI support for Dark Moon and Sun Soul monks, and for Paladins (rudimentary only) and Blackguards.</li>
<li>On EE installs, a couple of creatures are designated as Blackguards.</li>
<li>Monks now use Lay On Hands.</li>
<li>Allowed for the (admittedly kinda theoretical) case of good-aligned casters summoning Celestials.</li>
<li>Spellcasters now summon Celestials even if "Smarter Celestials" isn't installed.</li>
<li>Added console command to disable illithids' habit of going invisible on spec (favour to Angelsfury).</li>
<li>Added BGEE journal support.</li>
<li>Changed shadow thief battlemage from conjurer to invoker (to avoid glitches with her summoned help's allegiance if/when she changes sides) and lowered her level (she's normally supposed to lose).</li>
<li>Intelligent creatures no longer attempt to charm Cavaliers.</li>
<li>Being able to recover your items in Spellhold before confronting Irenicus is messing with the plot logic (of when you meet Saemon/find the portal) so I've reverted to the original where you get your items back after the final Ch4 battle. Squeal if it's too hard (or put spellhold_easycore=1 in the ini to restore previous behaviour.)</li>
<li>On non-enhanced versions of the game, "Faster Bears" (if you don't also use Improved Shapeshifting) does not affect the speed of shapeshifted druids. There are serious difficulties in implementing this on vanilla BG2; it's doable but a pain, so ask nicely if you use this.</li>
<li>Peasants and townspeople (i.e. L1 innocents) no longer propagate shouts or turn hostile when they hear a shout; they just get the hell out of Dodge.</li>
<li>Semaj no longer bothers with his original scripted teleport.</li>
<li>Tightened up the code for creatures going hostile if attacked (and, under the hood, externalised it to an SSL trigger block).</li>
<li>Creatures with a character class and the default (=9) value for a class-relevant ability score that has in-game effects (STR,CON for fighters; DEX for rogues; WIS for clerics) now have it randomly set to something sensible.</li>
<li>Mildly tweaked mid-level mages' Minor Sequencer choices towards offence.</li>
<li>Marked a few gith as fighter/mages based on some evidence that they were originally intended that way.</li>
<li>Mildly tweaked mages' defensive preferences in favour of Mantle et al over PMW.</li>
<li>Deprecated stronghold component.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated and debugged function library, fixing various problems en passant, notably including various area crashes.</li>
<li>Spell Trigger string is now correct on a non-EE install.</li>
<li>Liches are now immune to Cloudkill.</li>
<li>Descriptions of Breach et al are now correctly patched to allow for Iron Skins on a BGEE install.</li>
<li>Inquisitor dispel magic fix now correctly applied.</li>
<li>Corrected a typo that prevented the Universal Sequencer component from working.</li>
<li>Fine weapons on BGEE/TUTU should now shatter correctly.</li>
<li>Realistic wolves should now be working properly.</li>
<li>Werewolf (and other shapeshifter) tokens should now be made properly.</li>
<li>Reputation-increase component now sets rate correctly.</li>
<li>On TUTU installs, "remove tutors from Candlekeep" no longer breaks hit point initialisation.</li>
<li>"Remove tutors from Candlekeep" now also removes the ones in the inn.</li>
<li>Corrected a logic error which could lead to both lots of assassins spawning at the same time.</li>
<li>Kobold chieftain now gets his proficiencies correctly.</li>
<li>Ogre assassins now spawn correctly.</li>
<li>Wolf of Ulcaster should correctly use its powers.</li>
<li>Additional werewolves spawn correctly.</li>
<li>Worked around a rather subtle BGEE shift in the way some actions work that was causing Icharyd to break.</li>
<li>Kobold ambush on mines level 3 now triggers correctly.</li>
<li>Power Word Blind has a correct scroll description.</li>
<li>Wand of Spell Striking version of Breach is correctly modified (should be relevant only on Enhanced Edition).</li>
<li>Corrected errors in the group designation for some "Gameplay" components.</li>
<li>Correction of THAC0 errors is less aggressive.</li>
<li>Fixed some glitches in the assignment of (mostly thief) HLAs.</li>
<li>Cambions no longer cast spells instantly.</li>
<li>Clay Golems' Cursed Wounds effect should work correctly now.</li>
<li>Wizards now correctly handle the situation where Smarter Fiends is not installed.</li>
<li>Devas now get a proper script.</li>
<li>Fixed some serious problems with Smarter Fiends fiend-summoning spells.</li>
<li>Beholders' sequencers and prebuffs work correctly even if the beholder component is installed later.</li>
<li>Mages' Minute Meteors and Energy Blades are now dispelled by Dispel Magic.</li>
<li>Fixed a glitch in the spellcaster-level algorithm which was giving too-high levels to spellcasters with illegally many low-level spells.</li>
<li>Brimstone gets proper dragon scripting etc.</li>
<li>Sahuagin priests correctly receive stoneskins.</li>
<li>A few djinni missing their combat scripts now get them.</li>
<li>"Skip Candlekeep" now works properly on a BGEE install.</li>
<li>Beholder flesh to stone is no longer broken.</li>
<li>Irenicus now has the presence of mind to confiscate Shadow Thieves' potions before casting Rapture of the Father on them.</li>
<li>Spells with persistent graphical effects (e.g. Blade Barrier) no longer lose those effects when cast as part of a prebuff routine.</li>
<li>In certain circumstances, mages were trying to Imprison the protagonist.</li>
<li>Davaeorn no longer gets potions of Superior Healing.</li>
<li>Cambion spellcasters no longer lose their combat scripts.</li>
<li>Ogre Magi are less pusillanimous and now engage in combat.</li>
<li>Death Knight in Durlag's Tower now receives his combat script.</li>
<li>Demogorgon and Melissan have been back to mage school and now realise that their version of "Stoneskin" cannot be dispelled by Carsomyr.</li>
<li>Skeleton Warriors are now consistently flagged as undead that are immune to turning. (In vBG1 their turning immunity is rather crudely handled by making them MONSTERs rather than UNDEAD; BGEE restores their UNDEAD status but ignores turn immunity.) Among other effects this should prevent BG1 skeleton warriors from using healing potions.</li>
<li>Fallen Solar in non-Ascension games now summons allies correctly.</li>
<li>Beasts in the Copper Coronet more reliably go hostile.</li>
<li>Clerics' wisdom is now correctly figured into their number of spells.</li>
<li>The Ascension version of Gromnir now gets a proper combat script.</li>
<li>The "Smarter Gromnir" component now allows correctly for players who have Ascension but not Tougher Gromnir, or vice versa, installed.</li>
<li>The twelfth statue in level one of Watchers' Keep now activates correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed (harmless) offset mismatch in Anadramatis' amulet.</li>
<li>Vampyre now correctly affected by Vampires component.</li>
<li>Gith fighter-mages now get their psionic abilities.</li>
<li>Female demons no longer exemplify feminist critiques of gender essentialism.</li>
<li>Resources required for Cythandria's golems are now correctly present.</li>
<li>BG1 greater werewolves no longer drop Rings of Free Action.</li>
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Now that Big Picture main component is much more broken down, there's no reason to overwrite BP generic scripts, so we don't.</li>
<li>Make some effort to force SSL to output lowercased files. (If I'm still sometimes doing uppercase, someone shout.)</li>
<li>Muggers only disappear in the docks and the slums, not indoors, avoiding problems with multiple use of SPMUGGx.</li>
<li>Various spell and item components now check for Spell Revisions/Item Revisions and install only if it isn't present.</li>
<li>Removed a couple of redundant spell-sequencer scripts from Ascension wizards.</li>
<li>Make proper allowance for the fact that Cacofiend (aka Summon Death Knight) is a Necromancy and not a Conjuration spell in SR; ditto for cleric Gate. En passant, this should solve a nasty crash bug with SR/SCS combinations.</li>
<li>SR's "Sphere of Chaos" and "Cause Critical Wounds" should now be used correctly.</li>
<li>On SR+SCS installs, enemy-summoned glabrezu no longer attack their summoner.</li>
</ul>
<b>Post-release silent fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed v25.0 bug that prevented immunity effects being cloned to apply to sequencer-cast spells.</li>
<li>"1/4" option on Reduce Reputation Gain now works.</li>
<li>Imoen, though still annoying in other respects, no longer pretends to be a dwarf on BGEE/TUTU installs when asked to wait at an inn.</li>
<li>Minor optimisation to kit-enforcement function.</li>
<li>"Improved Durlag's Tower" no longer requires "Smarter General AI" to be installed.</li>
<li>Creation of the "setup-stratagems" exe file is slightly more robust.</li>
<li>Carnifex no longer thinks he's Agent Smith.</li>
<li>Support for non-English languages on a BGEE/BG2EE install (thanks for Wisp for the trick for doing this)</li>
</ul>
