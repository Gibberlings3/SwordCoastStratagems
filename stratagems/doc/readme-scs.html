<h2>Compatibility and Installation Order</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <h3><acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym></h3> 
  <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> now appears to be
    compatible with pretty much all the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> mods
    in common use. In particular, it has now been extensively tested with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>,
    Unfinished Business and the Grey Clan, as well as most <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> mods. It is compatible
    with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> with or
    without the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion.</p> 
  <p> In general, on a <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> should
    be installed last or close-to-last, after any quest, <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> and item mods. For
    a very detailed set of notes on compatibility between different <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> mods,
    see <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=8122">here</a>.</p> 
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> should be compatible with both EasyTUTU and TUTU v4, though the most recent version has only been tested on an EasyTUTU install.</p>
  <h3><acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym></h3> 
  While <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> was originally
  designed with a <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-only (i.e., not <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>)
  install in mind, it now seems to run pretty smoothly on <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>.
  The range of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> mods is so
  huge that it is difficult to give general installation advice; in general,
  though, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> should be installed
  as late as possible in the install order, and certainly after most or all <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>-content mods, but before
  <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems II">SCSII</acronym>.
  However (for slightly complex reasons) the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> improvements
  from the Quest Pack need to be installed before <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> (to
  be precise: before the Durlag's Tower component of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>).
  <p> Players trying to build a complicated <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> install
    involving Sword Coast Stratagems are strongly advised to seek advice on the
    boards at <a href="http://forums.spellholdstudios.net">forums.spellholdstudios.net</a>. </p> 
  <h3>Original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym></h3> 
  <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> is <strong>not</strong> compatible
    with the original (non-Tutu) version of <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, and I have no plans to make it compatible
    (the scripting language is too irritating). </p> 
  <h3>Overlap with other mods</h3> 
  <p>Some of the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> ease-of-use
    components overlap with some other mods. In particular:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The "wait-at-inns" component of <acronym 
  title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> isn't compatible with the wait-in-inns
      component of <acronym 
  title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
  title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. Choose which one you want; you'll
      only be allowed to install one. (They're very similar, though.) </li> 
    <li>The "move <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to more
      convenient locations" component overlaps harmlessly with the move-<acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> components
      of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
  title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>. (They move Alora, Eldoth, Tiax
      and Quayle; we move Eldoth, Tiax, Quayle, Viconia and Shar-Teel). </li> 
    <li>The "allow player to choose <acronym 
  title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> proficiencies and skills" component
      of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> tries to do rather
      the same thing as the "<acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>-style <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>" component
      of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks. This is also harmless: you should be able to install them
      in either order, but the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> version
      overrides the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks version whichever way round you install them.
      (The only reason you might want both installed is that <acronym 
  title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> doesn't affect third-party <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. </li> 
  </ul> 
</div> 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> is a very standard <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod,
    packaged in an auto-installing file. To install it, run it and tell it to
    install in your Tutu folder (for EasyTutu players), or your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    (for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> or Tutu v4 players).
    If you want to modify your installation later (or if for some reason you
    don't get the install program to start with) then double-click on setup-scs.exe
    in that folder.</p> 
  <p>You don't need to start a new game to install <acronym 
title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>. It's recommended that you do, though
    - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> affects things right
    through the game and if you install it part-way through, you'll almost certainly
    miss things.</p>
<p>On Mac OSX, follow the above instructions, except that you should click on setup-scs.command.
<p>On Linux, usual instructions apply: Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> 
and extract (at least) the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal, cd to 
your BGT/BGTUTU installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries. Finally, run WeInstall scs to install the mod.

<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section">Sword Coast Stratagems (<acronym 
title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>) is a collection of mini-mods for
  Baldur's Gate: Tutu and Baldur's Gate Trilogy. Its main
  focus is on increasing the tactical challenge of the game, through a combination
  of much smarter <acronym
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> and mild increases in the abilities
  of various creatures (many named enemies gain a couple of levels, mid- and
  high-level creatures often start with a potion or two, and so on.) In many
  ways it resembles the Tactics mod for <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, though it's generally rather more "low-key" -
  enemies get smarter and more dangerous but they don't gain vast sets of new
  powers.
  <p>It also includes a collection of components that improve <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-related aspects of game-play in small
    ways - for instance, it implements the useful <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> feature where you can send <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to inns when you don't need them;
    it lets you break up <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> pairs
    like Khalid/Jaheira without having to arrange for one of them to get killed;
    it lets you choose <acronym title="Non-Player Character's">NPC's</acronym> weapon
    proficiencies rather than being stuck with the game's preset choices; and
    it allows Yeslick, the dwarven fighter-cleric, to use axes.</p> 
  <p>It also tweaks a few other aspects of gameplay: for instance, it tones down
    Fire and Ice arrows a bit; it adds Potions of Extra-Healing to a few of the
    temples; it replaces most of the game's standard +1 magic weapons with non-magical "fine" weapons
    (for those who get irritated at the sheer number of permanent magic items
    lying around); and it gives bears a half-decent movement rate.</p> 
  <p>Finally, it implements a couple of very minor ease-of-use patches that don't
    seem to be included in the standard mods: for instance, it lets you skip
    the Candlekeep tutorial at the start of the game and it lets you move Boo
    out of Minsc's quick access and into his pack.</p> 
  <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> is very customisable
    - it's broken up into 40-odd components, so you can choose what you want.</p>
  <p>Originally, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> (with
    a few exceptions) avoided introducing <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> magic into <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> - so mages wouldn't use Stoneskins
    or Sequencers and couldn't cast enemy-only Dispel Magic, clerics didn't use Holy
    Smite, and so forth. As of version 9, though, optionally you can choose for enemies to use <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> resources.
  <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> introduces virtually
    no cool new magic items, and virtually no extra experience or loot. Personally,
    I think the treasure levels in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> are
    rather nicely balanced - a design principle of this mod was: don't unbalance
    them.</p> 
  <p>A couple of tweaks you might not notice if you install the whole package:
    Yeslick the dwarf cleric/fighter can now use axes (actually so can all cleric/fighters
    but that's not deliberate!), and the Protection from Normal Missiles spell
    works on almost all missiles now, not just non-magic ones. (It doesn't affect
    arrows of Detonation, Slaying or Dispelling.) </p>
</div> 
<h2>Detailed Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <h3>6A: Initialise component</h3>
  <p><strong>This component is required for almost all other components</strong></p> 
This component does various setup tasks needed by most other components in SCS. You won't directly notice what it does, but it fixes a few bugs and extends the game's capabilities to allow
  the rest of SCS to function correctly. (For experts: it installs Detectable Spells and (on Windows installs) ToBEx, makes magic items detectable, modifies weapons so that the script engine can detect their enchantment level, fixes the bugged Spell Shield spell, reconfigures area-effect spells so that Mirror Image doesn't block them, prevents casting from being disrupted by zero-damage attacks, fixes the Beregost bug, and installs a collection of low-level tweaks and fixes to creature statistics.)</p>
  <p>(Advanced users who find my mods slightly too good at detecting items may
  wish to experiment with setting AI_Does_Not_Detect_Items to 1 in scs/scs.ini; this isn't recommended, though.)</p>

  <h3>6B: Spell Tweaks</h3>
  These components (most of which are borrowed from my  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> mod, Sword Coast Stratagems II) makes
  a few small tweaks to the spell system, mostly to correct odd inconsistencies or to make certain tactics less overpowered. Most of them actually
  have only limited effects in a BG1-only game.
 <p><strong>Make Protection from Normal Missiles affect magical projectiles</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the power of the <acronym
  title="Protection from Normal Missiles">PNM</acronym> spell. It now blocks almost
    all arrows, bolts etc. The exceptions are the Arrows of Detonation, the Arrows
    of Slaying, and the Arrows of Dispelling.</p> 
  <p>The logic behind this is basically that magic arrows are two a penny in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>.
    It's essentially pointless for an enemy mage to use <acronym 
title="Protection from Normal Missiles">PNM</acronym>, since any prepared party
    worth their salt will just swap to magic ones. (By contrast, in pen-and-paper
    <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym> magic arrows are often fairly rare at mid levels). By making <acronym 
title="Protection from Normal Missiles">PNM</acronym> more impervious, enemy
    mages gain a basic defence against long-range attack, compensating for the
    lack of Stoneskin in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>.</p> 
  <p>You don't need this component to use the Smarter Mages scripts, but you'll
    find them a lot easier to kill if it isn't installed.</p> 
<p>As of version 12, there is a lower-key version of this component available. It replaces all +1 arrows in the 
game with non-magical masterwork arrows, and it changes the spell so only arrows which are +1 or better can penetrate it. The practical
upshot is the same as the normal component except that +2 arrows penetrate Protection from Magic Weapons; however, purists may prefer it on style grounds.
     <p>If you install this component on a <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> install,
    it will (obviously) affect the spell in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> as well as in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>.</p> 
  <p><strong>More consistent Breach spell (always affects liches and rakshasas;
      doesn't penetrate Spell Turning</strong></p> 
  <p>Although it isn't documented, the 5th level spell Breach will remove a creature's
    combat protections (such as Stoneskin) even if that creature is protected
    by Spell Deflection, Spell Turning or Spell Trap; it will not, however, affect
    creatures like liches or rakshasas, because they are immune to spells of
    level 5 or below (not that there are many of the latter in Baldur's Gate I!). This component removes both features: Breach now bounces
    off Spell Turning (etc.), but it affects even those creatures immune to "normal" 5th
    level spells.</p> 
  <p> Once this component is installed, the Breach effect of the Wand of Spell
    Striking will behave in exactly the same way as the Breach spell. </p> 
  <p> Enemy wizards will assume Breach works this way (and so won't target characters
    protected by Spell Turning etc with a Breach), even if you don't install
    this component. </p> 
    <p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII.</p>
  <p>This component changes those spells which target a creature's spell defences
    (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Secret Word, Spellstrike,
    Ruby Ray of Reversal - but not Breach) so as to allow them to target creatures which are protected by Improved Invisibility. (This works by targetting the closest hostile, protected
    creature to the target point.)
    The idea of this component is that these spells can now be cast on enemy
    mages who are protected by Improved Invisibility - this makes the Improved
    Invisibility / Spell Immunity: Divination combination less overpowering.</p> 
  <p> Prior to version 16, this component worked by giving the spells a small area of effect. This option remains, as a legacy component, for those who prefer it.</p>
  <p> The antimagic attacks of enemy mages will bypass Improved Invisibility
    even if you don't install this component.</p>
   <p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII.</p>
  <p><strong>Iron Skins behaves like Stoneskin (can be brought down by Breach)</strong></p> 
  <p>For some reason the Iron Skins spell, although it appears identical to a
    Stoneskin, counts as a Spell Protection (like Spell Turning) and not as a
    Combat Protection (like Stoneskin). This means that in the unmodded game,
    Breach does not bring down Iron Skins, but (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>)
    Secret Word does. This component relabels Iron Skins as a Combat Protection.</p> 
  <p> Enemy mages will assume that Iron Skins works this way (and so will, <acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>,
    cast Breach at it) even if you don't install this component.</p>
      <p><strong>Reduce the power of Inquisitors' Dispel Magic</strong></p>
    <p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII.</p>
    <p> Inquisitors have a very fast powerful Dispel Magic ability, which is cast
    at twice their level. In most bits of the game, this is usually much higher
    than the majority of spellcasting enemies. This component reduces the power
    of the Dispel a little; you can choose to use it at 1.5xlevel or at 1xlevel.</p>
    <p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII.</p>
<p><strong>Slightly reduce the power of Insect Plague spells (and the like) and let Fire Shields block them</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodified game, Insect Plague and Creeping Doom are very hard indeed for a spellcaster to deal with or defend against. This component
(which was partly inspired by Demivrgvs's Spell Revisions) grants a per-round saving throw against the spell-failure effects of the insects; it also
cause the insects to be destroyed if the target protects himself/herself with a Fire Shield spell (either colour) or Aura of Flaming Death spell. (This component will have only limited effect in a BG1-only game, since few characters will have the power to use Insect Plague.)
    <p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmetic change: stop Stoneskins from changing your character's colour</strong></p>
The Stoneskin spell causes the recipient to turn a uniform grey colour, which is realistic but does get a bit monotonous when your spellcasters are permanently
protected by it. This tweak  (which uses Ascension64's "ToB Extender")  removes the colour change from the spell.
    <p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII.</p>
<p><strong>Make spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them
to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency.</p>
<p>Note that if you have Smarter Mages installed, SCS enchanters will use sequencers and the like even if you do not have this component installed.</p>
<p>This component is identical to the equivalent component of SCSII. In BG1, you'll only see it for Minor Sequencers.</p>
    <h3>6C: Item Tweaks</h3>
    These are a collection of small changes to the items available in the game.
  <p><strong>Make elemental arrows more like <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>The arrows of Fire, Ice and Acid in <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> are seriously powerful in terms of damage
    done - much more so than their equivalents in <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>, presumably because the designers chose
    to tone it down a bit. This component applies a similar tonedown to <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> (not quite identical; they're still a bit
    more powerful than the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> versions).</p> 
  On a <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> install, the only
  effect of this component is to tone down the effects of the Bolt of Lightning
  (which is actually quite powerful even in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>).
  <p><strong>Replace many magic weapons with fine ones</strong></p>
  <p>This replaces most of the standard (i.e. non-named) +1 weapons in the game
    with non-magical equivalents: they still give you +1 to hit and damage but
    they don't give you +1 to initiative and they can't harm creatures that are
    immune to normal weapons.</p> 
  <p>This is mostly a cosmetic change: I wrote it because otherwise there are
    implausibly many magic weapons lying around the Sword Coast. It has two significant
    effects on the game, though. Firstly, +1 weapons cost a lot less (about a
    third as much). This mostly works against you (you generally find +1 weapons
    on enemies and sell them). More seriously, the iron plague affects "fine" weapons.
    I actually quite like this (feels more realistic, and makes the iron plague
    more a part of the game) but if it's just going to annoy you, don't use it.</p>
  <p>As of version 4 of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>,
    you can choose to have Fine weapons without the effects of the iron crisis.
    It's clear from what you're told in-game that the crisis affects all iron
    (even iron not forged from Nashkel ore), but some people feel this is outweighed
    by the annoyance of having your high-quality weapons break so much. It's
    up to you.</p> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> users should note that
    this component also affects weapons which you find in the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> part of the
    game. This component is <em>incompatible</em> with the similar component
    of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCSII</acronym> (it doesn't matter which one you install, except that the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCSII</acronym>    versions will not be shatter-proof).</p> 
  <p><strong>Reintroduce potions of extra-healing</strong></p> 
  <p>This places smallish numbers of potions of extra-healing at some of the
    temples (see <a href="#healing">here</a> for
    details). It's mostly here because some of the enhanced encounters give potions
    of extra-healing to the bad guys, and it's rather unfair if the player can't
    buy them too.</p> 
    <p><strong>Remove Arrows of Dispelling from stores</strong></p>
  <p>This component removes all the Arrows of Dispelling from the stores in BG1; you might
  want to install this if you find Arrows of Dispelling a bit too effective. 
  <h3>6D: Gameplay Tweaks</h3>
  These could equally have been called "miscellaneous tweaks". Most but not all are concerned with easier NPC management.
  <p><strong>Standardise spells between <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></strong></p>
    <p>At the moment, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>
    are both a bit inconsistent in their use of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>-only spells (like Stoneskin or Holy
    Smite). Non-player characters don't have any of these spells, and enemies
    don't use them, but party sorcerors, clerics and druids have access to them,
    and party mages can choose them at first level.</p>
  <p>This component offers two alternative ways to resolve the inconsistency. The first (available only 
  for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> players) blocks player access to all
    <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>-only spells except for Find Familiar and the various wild-magic spells.</p>
  <p>(A version of this component was previously available as part of TutuFix,
    but turned out to be buggy and to cause occasional crashes. This version
    works by a different principle, and should (touch wood) be crash-free.)</p>
    <p>The second alternative (new as of version 9) reintroduces into <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> all of the
    new wizard spells of fifth level or lower. Some are added to stores, others to treasure caches; see <a href="#scrolls">here</a> for
    all of the locations.
  <p><strong>Faster bears</strong></p>
  <p>"If you're in the woods, and you run into an angry bear, don't worry about
    it. Bears can't move very fast, you can outdistance it at a brisk walk".</p> 
  <p>It's unrealistic that <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> bears
    can't catch up with the party. This component tweaks their movement rate
    until it's about the same as for humans. This also makes the druid's bear
    shapeshift less annoying. </p> 
  <p> This component is identical to the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCSII</acronym> component of the same name and
    only one will be installable at a time (this is only relevant for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players.) </p> 
  <p><strong>Allow player to choose <acronym
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> proficiencies and skills</strong></p>
  <p>At the moment the various <acronym
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> who join your party have their existing
    proficiencies, thief skills etc. determined for you according to what the
    designers of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and/or Tutu had
    in mind. There's nothing wrong with this, but it can be interesting - especially
    if you've played several times - to have more flexibility.</p> 
  <p>This component gives you the chance to select each character's proficiencies
    from scratch. It does so in a slightly convoluted way (to get around game-engine
    difficulties): when a new <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> joins
    your party, they start at level 0. They immediately go up a level, so you
    get to choose their starting skills. As soon as you've levelled them, they
    gain enough experience to go up to about the level of the <acronym 
title="Player Character">PC</acronym>, and you can give them any remaining proficiencies.</p> 
  <p>This differs from the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks version (which is overwritten) because
    you get to choose proficiencies even for 1st-level characters. The component
    only works for the "core" <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> in
    <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>, not for any <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> added
    by someone else's mod (or for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>).
    It won't work for a given <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> if you install it after you've already
    entered their area.</p> 
  <p><strong>Note</strong>:the patch takes a few seconds to come into effect.
    If there's a 3-4 second pause when your character's statistics (hit points,
    say) aren't right, don't worry about it.</p> 
  <p><strong>Allow <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> pairs
      to separate</strong></p> 
  <p>One of the more frustrating aspects of <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> is that many of the more interesting <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> come in inseparable pairs (Khalid
    and Jaheira, Minsc and Dynaheir, etc.) Of course, it's always possible to
    get round this by leaving one member of a pair in a building or getting them
    killed, but it does spoil the suspension of disbelief a bit.</p> 
  <p>This component allows you to separate the pairs. If you kick one member
    of a pair out of the party, then the other still leaves - but if you speak
    to one member of a pair and invite them to join up, you get a dialogue option
    to take them but not their partner.</p> 
  <p>For technical reasons, this component and the next are combined into a single <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> component, "Better
    <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPC</acronym> management".</p> 
  <p><strong><acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> go to inns</strong></p> 
  <p>One of the nice features of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is
    the ability to ask <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to
    meet you somewhere else, rather than just getting them to stand around forlornly.
    This component introduces this feature for the "core" <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. You can send them to the Friendly
    Arm inn, the Elfsong tavern in Baldur's Gate (from chapter 5), the Nashkel
    Inn (if you've been to Nashkel), or the Jovial Juggler in Beregost (if you've
    been to Beregost). You can't send them there from Balduran's Isle, the Ice
    Island, the Candlekeep dungeons, or the lower levels of Durlag's Tower..</p>
  <p>To send someone to an inn, first kick them out of the party. Then talk to
    them - you should be given the opportunity to ask them to go to an inn and
    await you there.</p> 
  <p>This component isn't compatible with the similarly-named <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> component "<acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> wait at inns". Install whichever
    one you want (you won't be allowed to install more than one). There isn't
    much difference between the two - the dialogue is handled a bit differently,
    and this version lets you send people to more inns.</p> 
  <p>For technical reasons, this component and the next are combined into a single <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> component, "Better
    <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> management".</p> 
  <p><strong>Allow Yeslick to use axes</strong></p> 
  <p>It seems appropriate that Yeslick, who is a dwarven fighter-cleric, ought
    to be able to use the traditional dwarven weapon; this component allows him
    to.</p> 
  <p>(There is a loophole here: due to the way the game engine works, this actually
    allows all fighter-clerics (not just Yeslick) to use axes. Yeslick is actually
    the only <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> fighter-cleric
    in the core game but it might affect third-party <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>, or your primary character (and,
    for <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> users, it will affect
    Anomen). If you want to take advantage of this then be my guest, but it wasn't
    the intended function of the component.)</p> 
  <p><strong>Move <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to more
      convenient locations</strong></p> 
  <p>Many of the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> are inconveniently located - either
    at places where you can't get to at all until late in the game (e.g. Baldur's
    Gate, the Cloakwood), or places where you in principle could get to but realistically
    wouldn't. This makes it annoying to experiment with varying your party: you
    have to leave extended gaps in your party until quite late, or unrealistically
    sneak into later-game areas to act on your Reload Knowledge of where someone
    is.</p> 
  <p>This component moves as many as possible of the <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> to locations where you are likely
    to run into them fairly early in the game. Obviously it doesn't move all
    by any means (many have plot-related reasons for their locations).</p> 
  <p>See <a href="#npcs">here</a> for details of who has been moved and
    to where. Note that this component will only work if you start a new game.</p> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> also
    moves some <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. If you've got <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> installed, this component will only
    move those <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> (Shar-Teel
    and Viconia) whom <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> leaves alone. </p> 
<p><strong>Improved shapeshifting</strong></p>
<p>This component (inspired in part by Wesley Weimer's Shapeshifter Rebalancing component) modifies all of the druid innate shapeshift abilities
to be useable instantly (that is, without requiring a six-second cooldown before the next spell can be cast). It does so by creating "symbolic paws":
if you equip one, you instantly shapeshift. Other than that, the effects of the shapeshift are largely the same as previously, though some of the ability score
and attack bonuses have been tweaked slightly. Note that shapeshifting still blocks spellcasting. </p>
<p>If you have both this component and the "improved priests" component installed, enemy druids will use improved shapeshifting. </p>
  <p><strong>Prevent party members from dying irreversibly</strong></p>
  <p>This component tries to prevent "chunking", the annoying permanent death of your
    character when you're reduced below -10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym>.
    Characters who get reduced to 0 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> or
    below just die in the usual fashion and can be resurrected. It isn't possible
    to prevent quite all forms of chunking (massive damage from fire, in particular, still seems to cause chunking fairly reliably), but this component should make it
    a rarer occurrence. </p> 
    <p>This component is identical to the equivalent SCSII component.
  <p><strong>Reduce the rate of reputation gain</strong></p>
  <p>In general, if you're playing a half-way honorable character in BG2, your reputation fairly rapidly reaches 20 and stays there. The idea of this component 
  is to slow down the rate at which you gain reputation: you can choose the degree of slowdown.</p>
  <p>In more detail: any time you would have gained 2 or more reputation points, you gain one fewer point than you should have. Any time you would have gained one,
  it's decided at random whether you actually do gain it, according to the probability you choose at install time.</p>
     <p>This component is identical to the equivalent SCSII component.
  <p><strong>More realistic wolves and dogs</strong></p>
  <p>In the real world, wolves rather rarely attack humans; indeed, they normally keep their distance. In the Sword Coast, though, wolves are
  apparently ruthless, fearless predators that think nothing of attacking even large parties of heavily armed adventurers.
  (And, as a corollary, even wilderness-oriented types like rangers and druids spend much of their time fighting off attacks from 
  implacable wolf packs.)</p>
  <p>This component makes the behaviour of wolves (and also wild dogs) a bit more realistic. They won't <b>usually</b> attack humans
  (they still do sometimes: it's been a harsh winter and game is scarces). They'll generally retreat if more than a few of them are injured or
  killed. If you approach them, they might take a bite out of you, but just as likely, they'll keep their distance.</p>
  <p>This component has no effect on non-"normal" wolves (dire wolves, winter wolves and the like), since for all I know,
  they really <b>are</b> ruthless predators. Its main point is to spare the author (who rather likes wolves) the heartache
  of perpetually having to cut them down and listen to the rather sad yelp they make when you kill them.</p>
    <h3>6E: Cosmetic and ease-of-use tweaks</h3>
      <p><strong>Skip Candlekeep</strong></p>

   <p>The Prologue to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> is a perfectly
    good tutorial in the Infinity Engine for complete beginners. By the time
    you return to it in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>,
    it's unutterably tedious - but you more-or-less have to do it, because even
    the small amount of gold and <acronym 
title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> it gives you is pretty vital for later.
    It doesn't really even add colour, because realism is always being spoiled
    by these damn monks telling you which button to press.</p> 
  <p>This less-than-serious component, inspired by <acronym 
title="Pocket Plane Group">PPG</acronym>'s Dungeon-Be-Gone, lets you skip the
    whole thing. At the start of the adventure, a guard will come up to you and
    give you the chance to collect all the cash and <acronym
title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> from him. He'll give you a decent interval
    to shop, and then teleport you direct to Gorion ready for the start-of-game
    ambush.</p> 
  <p>Be warned that the dialogue with the guard is unrealistic and written for
    laughs (but then, most of the prologue dialogue is unrealistic). Realism
    is restored once you start talking to Imoen and Gorion.</p> 
  <p><strong>Remove blur effect from displacer cloak</strong></p> 
  <p>Like it says really: this removes the annoying blurry graphic when someone
    wears the displacer cloak.</p> 
  <p><strong>Stackable ankheg shells, winterwolf pelts and wyvern heads</strong> </p>
  These aren't infinitely stackable in the "standard" inventory-management mods,
  or at least they weren't last time I checked.
  <p><strong>Move Boo out of quick access and into Minsc's pack</strong></p>
  <p>I love Boo, really I do, but it's infuriating that he eats up one of Minsc's
    quickslots. This patch just moves him into a slot in Minsc's backpack. It
    won't work if you install it after you arrive at Nashkel. </p>
   <p>This component is identical to the SCSII component of the same name.</p>
   <p> <strong> Ensure Shar-Teel doesn't die in the original challenge</strong></p>
  <p> Shar-Teel is rather fragile: it's easy to kill her by mistake in the battle
    where you recruit her. This component guarantees that she survives the battle. </p> 
  <p><strong>Ease-of-use party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>This <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script, suitable
    for all characters, is not intended to help you fight difficult battles,
    but it might make your life simpler (especially where pre-casting spells
    is concerned - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> virtually requires you to do a lot of precombat spellcasting
    of long-duration spells, but it's tedious to do manually.) The <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> has
    5 functions: </p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>The character will fight, prioritising opponents who are not immobile
      and helpless, not fighting if they're trying to Turn Undead, and not wasting
      Melf's Minute Meteors, Energy Blades or Invisibility (the idea of this <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is
      to help you mop up weak opponents, so it conserves resources). You can
      shift the character between melee (D) and ranged weapons (F) using the
      hotkeys. <br /> 
      If you'd rather that your character did not enter melee, you can toggle
      melee off by pressing (K). Characters with melee toggled off will fight
      if enemies are in weapon range but won't be proactive about getting into
      range. </li> 
    <li>The character will cast some long-duration spells when out of combat.
      There are 4 settings for this, which you can toggle through using (S).
      On setting 1, the character uses no spells. On setting 2 and up, the character
      will cast all of the following spells if they are memorized (and not already
      active): Stoneskin, Iron Skins, Armor, Melf's Minute Meteors, Goodberry. </li> 
    <li>On setting 2 and up, the character will consume Goodberries if injured
      and out of combat. On setting 3 and up, the character will also consume
      potions of healing. On setting 4, the character will consume potions of
      extra-healing. </li> 
    <li>On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically activate the following
      items once per day: the Cloak of the Stars; the Gargoyle Boots; the Belt
      of Fortitude. </li> 
    <li>The character will cast some spells, by hotkey, on the whole party. This
      casting is highly accelerated, cannot be done in combat, and only casts
      on characters who are not already protected. Its main function is for later
      in the game when you can afford to carry enough spells to protect the whole
      party. The hot-keys are: C for Chaotic Commands; V for Death Ward; B for
      Protection from Fire, Protection from Lightning, and Protection from Magic
      Energy; Z for the paladin's Protection from Evil. (The latter key is already
      allocated to a hotkey (sleep) - sorry, I was running out of hotkeys. To
      use it you'll need to disable Z in the Configuration program.
<p>This component is identical to the equivalent component in SCSII.</p>
  <h3>6F: <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> modifications</h3>
  <p>The distinction between this section and the next ("tactical challenges") is a bit arbitrary,
  but basically components in this section either don't alter creatures' abilities at all, or do so in a relatively low-key way.</p>

  <p><strong>Smarter general <acronym
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>This component significantly improves the "generic" <acronym
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> used by most non-spellcasters in
    the game. Characters with potions will use them; archers will choose their
    targets intelligently; creatures have less chance of just randomly losing
    track of where the battle is; if you go away and rest then so will the monsters.</p> 
  <p>One general principle of this component (and of most of the <acronym
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> components) is that enemies usually
    will not waste time finishing off helpless (paralysed, asleep, feared, etc)
    characters. With very few exceptions, <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> opponents do not see themselves as there to
    soften up players so that later opponents can do better. They're fighting
    to win (albeit we as players know they're unlikely to) and so they're not
    going to kill someone paralysed who's out of the fight already.</p> 
  <p>What this means in practice is that although this mod hopefully makes the
    battles harder, it doesn't make them that much more lethal unless you're
    defeated altogether. As well as being (in my view) more realistic, this reduces
    the frustration of those constant trips back to town to resurrect someone.</p> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> users please note:
    this component should be installed <strong>before</strong> any mod (such
    as Big Picture or <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCSII</acronym>) which are intended to have the same function for
    the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> part of the game. If you do not install any such mod, all creatures
    (including <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> creatures) will use this 
	<acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Better calls for help</strong></p> 
  <p>This component substantially improves the (almost nonexistent) <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> scripting for monsters to help one another.
    Even the stupidest monsters will fight in groups (so the advance-a-few-steps-at-a-time
    strategy will fail); intelligent monsters will call out to nearby allies.
    There are some ways to abuse this component but generally it seems to strike
    a good compromise between amazingly unrealistic behaviour on the one hand,
    and the entire map emptying towards you on the other.</p>
  <p><strong>More sensible choices of weapon proficiencies and kits for fighters</strong></p>
  <p>This component ensures that the fighters in the game make intelligent use of their available weapon proficiency choices, by taking weapon and style specialisations as appropriate. It also allocates
  kits to a (fairly small) number of fighters, and corrects some inaccurate saving throws etc.</p>
<p>This component is identical to the SCSII component of the same name.</p>
  <p><strong>Potions for <acronym
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>Potions are one of the simplest ways in which <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> characters can boost their chances - this
    component evens the odds, by distributing potions to humanoid enemies. Most
    creatures get potions according to a level-based randomising process; a few
    have individual allocations. Roughly speaking:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>everyone above <acronym title="Level 4">L4</acronym> has some chance of healing potions, rising to certainty
      at <acronym title="Level 9">L9</acronym> </li> 
    <li>everyone above <acronym title="Level 6">L6</acronym> has some chance of a magic-protection potion, rising
      to certainty at <acronym title="Level 11">L11</acronym> </li> 
    <li>fighter-types above <acronym title="Level 4">L4</acronym> have some chance of a battle potion, rising to
      certainty at <acronym title="Level 9">L9</acronym> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>This component introduces extra-healing potions (in moderation) into the
    game. Note that (since I don't believe in undroppable items) it will probably
    mildly increase the number of potions that your party acquires. Playtesting
    suggests that this stays fairly under control, though.</p> 
  <p>There isn't much point installing this component unless you're using "Smarter
    general <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>" - otherwise
    enemies usually won't drink them.</p> 
  <p>As of version 9, you can optionally choose for some, all, or none of the new potions to be recoverable from enemies' bodies..</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter Mages</strong></p>
  <p>This component substantially increases the intelligence of the wizards (and
    ogre magi) who encounter the party. Area-effect spells won't be cast so as
    to kill the caster, wizards will use defensive spells like Invisibility and
    Minor Globe of Invulnerability, attack spells will be targetted at the most
    useful target rather than some random summoned monster, etc. Magic items
    such as wands and scrolls will be used against the party; fighter-mages will
    use spare moments to attack. </p> 
  <p>The component also changes the spell choices made by wizards so as
    to use less hopeless spells, and in some cases to remember to memorize the right number of spells; and in some cases
    it adjusts a wizard's level to match the spells he actually demonstrates in the game. </p>
    <p>As of version 9 of this mod, many wizards will be specialists of one sort or another (I use necromancers, conjurers, invokers and enchanters),
    and this should - hopefully - lead to a little more variety in the kind of spell use you see.
    <p>Also as of version 9, you can choose at install time if wizards will
    restrict themselves to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> spells
    - no spell sequencers, no Stoneskins, etc - or if they will memorise and use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> spells.  
    Particularly if you choose the first of these, I recommend that you install the "Make
    Protection from Normal Missiles affect magical projectiles" mod in order
    to make the wizards have a bit more of a fighting chance.
  <p>In addition, you can choose at install time whether or not wizards "pre-buff" - that is, whether they 
   pre-cast a range of defensive spells (Minor Globe, Mirror Image, etc.), simulating the pre-castings that players
    can do just before a fight starts. Mages presumably prepare in advance for
    a party's arrival by scrying, scouts etc., but this is impossible to simulate
    within the game engine. (Mages cast very-long-duration spells (Armor, Stoneskin, Minute Meteors)
    whether or not you install this component, because they're assumed to have cast them at the start of the day or beforehand.)
     </p>
  <p>Prebuffing is optional because opinions seem to vary
    about this sort of pre-battle casting. If you normally scout and raise defensive
    spells yourself, use it in order to ensure a fair fight; if not, you might
    not want to bother. Note, though, that "Smarter Mages" is primarily designed
    to use <strong>with</strong> this component; it's slightly less well optimized
    if you leave it uninstalled.</p> 
  <p>Incidentally, if you're worried about realism, it might help to assume (contradicting
    pen-and-paper <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>, to be sure) that mages can mentally deactivate their
    running defence spells, rendering them invisible and ineffective, at will.
    You more or less have to assume something like this for the party anyway,
    to explain why various people you meet don't bat an eyelid at the panoply
    of defensive magic swirling around the party mages!</p> 
  <p><strong>Smarter priests</strong></p> 
  <p>This component substantially increases the intelligence of the priests and
    druids who attack the party. Offensive spells like Flame Strike and Hold
    Person will be intelligently targetted, magic items like the Wand of the
    Heavens will be used against the party, paralysed and fearstruck allies will
    be healed, druids will shapechange in some circumstances, etc. The component
    changes the spells memorised by priests to more optimal choices, and in many
    cases adds extra spells, since the game often seriously undersupplies priests
    with spells. </p>
  <p>Priests use a limited amount of healing magic on themselves, but in general
    don't bother healing allies - it's too difficult to script in a way that
    avoids ludicrously stupid actions in some circumstances.</p> 
  <p>Pretty much all the priests you meet use the same script, but it has enough
    randomisation in it to (hopefully) remain varied and interesting.</p> 
  <p>As with the Smarter Mages component, you can choose at install time whether priests will pre-buff and whether they will use BG2 spells or
    confine themselves to <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> spells. However, this has been bent slightly
    in this component to allow druids use of Iron Skins and priests use of Physical
    Mirror even if you choose the latter option - these spells are high enough level that the player usually won't
    have access to them anyway, and without some sort of basic defence <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> priests
    and druids (who are often encountered alone) usually get slaughtered.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter deployment</strong></p>
  <p>Many <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> enemies foolishly walk
    right up to you before announcing their desire to kill you, despite the fact
    that they're spell-casters or archers. Other <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> characters who are blatantly going to <em>turn</em> hostile
    sit around waiting for you to surround them before talking to them.</p> 
  <p>This component modifies a couple of dozen opponents so that they talk to
    you on sight (like Davaeorn does) rather than waiting for you to talk to
    them or walking up to you.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter sirines and dryads</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the intelligence of sirines - their charms will
    be better targetted and they make more intelligent use of their invisibility.
    It also adds a little defensive magic to the hamadryad of the cloakwood -
    she is hopefully a little more of a challenge now.</p> 
  <p>This component has not been tested with the "Lure of the Sirine's Call" mod
    by Ghreyfain, but I expect it to be compatible.</p>
  <p><strong>Slightly harder carrion crawlers</strong></p> 
  <p>This small component increases carrion crawlers' attacks to 5 (closer to
    pen-and-paper <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>) and gives them a slightly smarter script - carrion
    crawlers know enough to continue paralysing moving opponents before feeding.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter basilisks</strong></p> 
  <p>This component spreads basilisks' gaze attacks around, rather than mechanically
    petrifying the nearest target. More importantly, it gives them the intelligence
    to see (eventually) that some targets are immune altogether, and to concentrate
    on others.</p>

<h3>6G: Tactical challenges</h3>
  Though the distinction isn't hard-and-fast, components in this section are less concerned with improving the intelligence of
  creatures, more concerned with increasing their abilities and numbers. (Though hopefully, creatures remain intelligent and 
  changes remain fairly low-key.)


  <p><strong>Improved doppelgangers</strong></p>
  <p>The doppelgangers in chapter 5 and later are by and large nothing like powerful
    enough to be an interesting challenge to a Tutu party at that level. This
    component improves them by adding a little extra magical power (see below
    for details - in keeping with their nature, it's mostly illusions and befuddling
    spells). Purists should note that this deviates from the pen-and-paper doppelganger.</p> 
  <p><strong>Harder spiders</strong></p> 
  <p>This component enhances the difficulty of some of the tougher spiders you
    meet in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> - it makes the Cloakwood,
    in particular, quite challenging. Basically, there are two changes: giant spiders cast webs every few rounds, and phase spiders teleport
    more effectively.</p>
<p>Be warned: this component has been fairly controversial! - lots of people find it too hard. Install at own risk.</p>
  <p><strong>Tougher Black Talons and Iron Throne guards</strong></p> 
  <p>This component upgrades the Black Talon Elite and (most of) the Iron Throne
    mercenaries to <acronym title="Level 5">L5</acronym> fighters. This doesn't have that much effect on the Black
    Talons (though they are now immune to Sleep); it's quite a substantial boost
    for some of the Iron Throne flunkies.</p>
    <p> <strong>Improved Deployment for Parties of Assassins</strong></p>
  <p> Two groups of assassins (one made up mostly of dwarves and gnomes, one
    made up entirely of amazons) hang out in the vicinity of Gullykin. This component
    removes them from there and makes them proactively hunt the party down instead
    - they'll show up at random times in chapter 3.</p> 
    <p>As of version 5 of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>, the assassins only spawn once your main character
    is above 3rd level. (The way I normally play the game, I'm always above 3rd
    level by the start of chapter 3, but apparently some people race through
    chapter 3 and then get slaughtered by the assassins.)</p>
  <p><strong>Dark-Side-based kobold upgrade</strong></p>
  <p>This component substantially increases the number of kobolds met, and adds
    some tougher "Guards" and "Chieftains" - the Nashkel Mine becomes less of
    a walkover, especially if "Better calls for help" is also being used. </p>
  <p>As the name suggests, this component is substantially based on a small subcomponent
    of the old "Dark Side of the Sword Coast" mod for <acronym
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>. I haven't been able to track anyone down
    from that mod to ask permission (I'm not really sure where to start) - it
    goes without saying that if the authors of that mod would like the component
    removed I'd be happy to oblige.</p>

  <p><strong>Relocated bounty hunters</strong></p>
  <p>In the original game, a tough group of bounty hunters are waiting pointlessly
    in a locked building in the Docks, with no explanation as to why. This small
    component moves them to somewhere more interesting - see <a 
href="#hunters">here</a> to find
    out where, if you want to spoil the suspense.</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Ulcaster</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves two of the tougher monsters in Ulcaster: Icharyd
    and the Vampiric Wolf. Both are pretty straightforward opponents in Tutu
    (more so than I remember from the original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>)
    and this component gives them a fighting chance. Both gain a few more hit
    points and some special powers (the Vampiric Wolf's powers are specific to
    the one in the ruins, they don't apply to all vampiric wolves).</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Balduran's Isle (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>) </strong></p> 
  <p>This component makes a number of changes to the "Balduran's Isle" component
    of Tales of the Sword Coast. A couple of the main fights are made more interesting
    and the dialogue with Kaishas and Mendas is substantially altered. It is
    now possible to seek a significantly less bloody resolution to the island
    voyage. (See <a 
href="#werewolf">here</a> for details.)</p>
  <p><strong>Improved Durlag's Tower (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>) </strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the tactical challenge of a number of the key battles
    in Durlag's Tower. It is designed to be used with the "Smarter Mages" and "Smarter
    Priests" components, though it's playable without them. (See <a
href="#durlag">here</a> for
    details.)</p> 
  <p>At least one of these battles is now actually quite hard, though still perfectly
    doable by a seventh-eighth level party.</p> 
  <p> As of version 3, the Mirror Fiend encounter has also been changed: the
    Fiends are now real copies of your party.</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Demon Cultists (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>)</strong></p> 
  <p>This component ups the capabilities of the demon cultists you meet in <acronym title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym>.
    It's designed to work with Smarter Mages and Smarter General <acronym 
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>; I don't vouch for its effectiveness
    without them. (See <a 
href="#demon">here</a> for details.)
    It's also pretty difficult for a party that isn't already 7th-8th level -
    be warned.</p> 
    <p><strong>Improved Cloakwood druids</strong></p>
    <p>The druids of the cloakwood, even with improved scripting, are a pushover for a well-played party. This component increases
    their levels slightly and gives each a couple of low-level acolytes.
    <p><strong>Improved Bassilus</strong></p>
    <p>This component slightly increases Bassilus's level; it also makes his undead flunkies die off a little less quickly even if
    you say the right thing to him.
    <p><strong>Improved Drasus party</strong></p>
    <p>This component upgrades the group of mercenaries you meet in chapter 4 guarding the Cloakwood mines: each gains a couple of levels.
    <p><strong>Improved Red Wizards</strong></p>
    <p>This component adds three levels to each of the Red Wizards of Thay you can meet in the Wood of Sharp Teeth.
    <p><strong>Improved Undercity assassins</strong></p>
    <p>This component enhances the (optional) final group of assassins you meet - each gains about three levels.
  <p><strong>Improved miscellaneous encounters</strong></p>
  <p>This component mildly increases the difficulty of a half-dozen or so battles
    scattered through the game, usually by increasing opponents' levels by one
    or two. It creates "divertingly" difficult fights
    rather than really stiff challenges. See <a
href="#misc">here</a> for the
    specific battles if you want to spoil the surprise!</p> 
  <p><strong>Tougher end-of-chapter battles</strong></p> 
  <p>These components (there are five of them) improve the strength and numbers
    of the opposition in the end battles in chapters 2-6 - they are "upgraded" rather
    than massively overhauled, so they still aren't ridiculously hard. See <a 
href="#chapterbattles">here</a> for
    details.</p> 
  <p><strong>Improved final battle (requires <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym> or <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>)</strong></p> 
  <p>By the end of the Tutu version of <acronym 
title="Tales of the Sword Coast">TotSC</acronym>, the final battle of <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> isn't much of a challenge. This component
    tries to change that and provide a worthier finale to the adventure. It turns
    out that Sarevok didn't just flee to the Temple of Bhaal because it looked
    pretty - he has other surprises... (see <a 
href="#sarevok">here</a> for
    details). </p> 
</div>

<h2> <a name="console" id="console">Power-user options (contains spoilers)</a> </h2>
<div class="section">
A certain amount of "fine tuning" of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> is available over and above your install options via the console. 
(For those who don't know, the console can be accessed by (1) adding the line "Cheats=1" (without the quote marks) to the baldur.ini file in your BG2 directory, just below the line "[Game Options]", and then (2) pressing CTRL-SPACE in-game.)
<p>
The options are all controlled by setting certain global variables, which is done by typing this command:
<p>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("[Global to set]","GLOBAL",[value to set it to])
<p>
So for instance, to set the variable SeduceBodhi to 3, type
<p>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("SeduceBodhi","GLOBAL",3).
<p>
The variables that can be set in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate">SCS</acronym> are these (all start as 0):
<ul>
<li>DMWWNeutralPrebuff - set to 1 to allow neutral mages and priests to have long-term defences like Stoneskin in place, rather than insta-casting them when they go
hostile. (Arguably this is more realistic, but it can be offputting.) Note that the default behaviour has been reversed as of version 10.</li>
<li>DMWWKillAndris - set to 1 while in the Ice Island Maze to kill Andris. (This is in response to persistent problems with his being unkillable - hopefully I've fixed it, but just in case...)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also possible to make a few more fine-tuned install options by editing the file scs/scs.ini. (This must be done <b>before</b> installing the mod.) This file can be edited in a text editor.
Each line consists of a configuration option, then a space, then a number. The only thing you should edit is the number.</p>
<p>The current configuration options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI_Does_Not_Detect_Items - set this to 1 if you want to experiment with the computer not being able to tell when your magic items protect you. (This will probably cause some odd behaviour.)
<li>Disable_ToBEx - set this to one to disable ToB Extender. (If you don't know what this means, don't do it.)
</ul>

</div>



<h2>Additional notes on content (contains spoilers)</h2>
<div class="section">
<p><strong><a name="corrections" id="corrections"></a>Correct various errors on race, class etc.</strong></p>
The full list of corrections is:
<ol>
<li>Some small errors are fixed in the join-party and leave-party dialogue.
<li>Davaeorn, Krystin, Daitel, Andris and Tellan have their classes and races corrected.
<li>Skeleton warriors are made monsters rather than human (they can't be made "undead" as they're non-turnable).
<li>For the same reason, Daitel is flagged as "monster" not "undead".
<li>Various jellies are marked as "slimes".
<li>Lots of random creatures marked as "mage" are corrected to "no class".
<li>Lycanthropes, doppelgangers and vampiric wolves are changed from "humanoid" to "monster".
<li>Vampiric wolves are redesignated as "wolf" and are no longer mages.
<li>A large number of incorrect THAC0s are corrected (usually to the benefit of the creature concerned; I wasn't particularly worried about inaccurately powerful NPCs).
<li>A large number of wizards (including ogre magi) with levels that don't match their spells are corrected (the mage scripts use level as an indicator).
<li>A large number of creatures with inaccurate saving throws are corrected.
<li>Some non-clerics recorded as clerics are corrected.
<li>Naaman's dexterity is modified from 11 (rather low for a mage-thief) to 17 
<li>Daitel, currently immune only to <em>magic</em> cold and fire, gets immunity to the nonmagical variety.
<li>The druids with Seniyad get proficient in their flame blades.
<li>Genthore isn't actually able to use his weapons. He gets proficiencies in the axe, and swaps his melee dagger (!) for a battleaxe.
<li>Niemain is wearing a Ring of Clumsiness. I've no idea whether this is deliberate, but it seems bizarre that he would engage the party in melee when at such a disadvantage, so I've taken it off his finger.
<li>Kobolds get one proficiency with the shortsword. (Currently they have none).
<li>Yago and Resar, supposedly powerful mages, don't actually get any spells at all. They're given some.
<li>Encounters with Gretek and Cyrdremac are rescripted to make them more reliably go hostile (currently they sometimes randomly don't bother).
<li>Conversely, the dialogues with the mad mages of the Ice Island seem to require that they start non-hostile.
<li>Some skeletons need to have their damage-resistance added.
<li>The casting levels for wands are made more consistent: wands of fire cast fireball at L3 (and continue to cast their high-powered Scorcher variant at L5); wands of lightning cast at L3; most other wands cast at L1. (This is relevant for penetrating MGI).
<li>The amnesia of the Nashkel merchant is corrected: he doesn't now comment on a winter wolf having been seen more than once. (If you can't stand this subcomponent, use the console and enter CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("DMWWNashkelPelt","GLOBAL",2) )
<li>Monster Summoning spells can now be targetted on creatures protected by globes of invulnerability and the like.
</ol>
<p><strong><a name="healing" id="healing"></a>Re-introduce potions of extra-healing.</strong></p>
<p>
There are three potions at the temple in the Friendly Arm Inn, five each at the Song of the Morning temple at Beregost and the 
Lady's temple in Baldur's Gate, and eight at the High Hall of Wonders in Baldur's Gate.
<p><strong><a name="scrolls" id="scrolls"></a>Standardise spells between <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym></strong></p>
<p>The locations of the new spells are as follows.
<ul>
<li>Feldepost's Inn: Reflected Image, Spook, Deafness
<li>High Hedge: Spook, Power Word: Sleep, Ray of Enfeeblement, Deafness, Minor Spell Deflection, Protection from Fire, Protection from Cold, Hold Undead
<li>Sorcerous Sundries: Power Word: Sleep, Ray of Enfeeblement, Minor Spell Deflection, Protection from Fire, Protection from Cold, Hold Undead, Melf's
Minute Meteors, Contagion, Secret Word, Farsight, Wizard Eye
<li>Alai: Minor Sequencer
<li>Davaeorn:  Remove Magic, Stoneskin
<li>Denak: Teleport Field
<li>Dezkiel: Stoneskin
<li>Halacan: Detect Illusion
<li>Kysus: Fire Shield: Red
<li>Niemain: Spider Spawn
<li>Nimbul: Find Familiar
<li>Resar: Fire Shield: Blue
<li>Tranzig: Glitterdust
<li>Venkt: Spell Thrust
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="npc" id="npc"></a>Move NPCs to more convenient locations.</strong></p>
<p>
The NPCs who are moved are:
<ul>
<li>Eldoth - moves from the Cloakwood to the woods south of the Friendly Arm.
<li>Quayle - moves from Baldur's Gate to the Nashkel Carnival
<li>Shar-Teel - moves from a fairly inaccessible bit of wilderness to the Nashkel-Beregost road
<li>Tiax - moves from Baldur's Gate to Beregost
<li>Viconia - moves from the eastern forest to the woods south of Beregost.
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="bounty" id="bounty"></a>Relocated bounty hunters.</strong></p>
<p>
These are the five ogre magi in the Docks district. They turn up just outside Candlekeep as you arrive at the start of chapter six.
<p><strong><a name="werewolf" id="werewolf"></a>Improved Balduran's Isle.</strong></p>
<p>Three fights are modified:
<ul>
<li>The battle with Karoug. Karoug himself is left alone, but Daese lives up to the villagers' warning about the wolfweres' magical powers. She becomes an eighth-level mage.
<li>The confrontation with Kaishas. Kaishas becomes a greater werewolf, with Free Action and immunity to all weapons except cold iron. (This seems to have been intended in BG1 but not properly implemented). She will also call for help from the tunnels: reinforcements will arrive at a rate of about one werewolf per round.
<li>The final battle with Selaad. Selaad and Baresh are now both greater werewolves, as well as being respectable opponents in human form - Baresh is a twelfth-level fighter, Selaad is a tenth-level mage. Only once reduced to below 25% hit points will they take on their wolfman forms.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, it is now possible to talk your way past Kaishas and on to the boat. Your protagonist needs either Intelligence 14+, or Wisdom 14+ and good alignment, and you need to have saved Maralee's baby and befriended Durlayle or Delainy. (This was an aspect of the original game that's always infuriated me - I <em>liked</em> Kaishas.)

<p><strong><a name="durlag" id="durlag"></a>Improved Durlag's Tower.</strong></p>
<p>
Four fights are modified:
<ul>
<li>The battle with "Love", "Pride", "Avarice", and "Fear" on the first dungeon level. They get extra hit points and/or regenerative capability, and three get improved magic powers.
<li>The doppelgangers on the second dungeon level - they are instructed to use their specific powers a bit more effectively. (This mostly affects Islanne's doppelgangers; it won't be all that effective without Smarter Mages).
<li>The duplicates that can emerge from the Mirror have been upgraded slightly.
<li>The chessboard battle has been significantly upgraded and is now quite difficult. The chess constructs have gained a variety of immunities (electricity, normal weapons, mind-affecting magic) to represent their status as constructs rather than humans; the pawns have gained more hit points. The King is now a 9th/7th level fighter/mage and the Queen is an 11th level mage. 
<br>(For what it's worth, my own solution to the fight was to refuse to play the chessboard game: make everyone immune to lightning and just go where you want. You should have enough potions of absorption by this stage.)
</ul>
 <p><strong><a name="demon" id="demon"></a>Improved demon cult.</strong></p>
<p>
The cult consists of:
<ul>
<li>Cult Guards: 8th level fighters. Their hit points are increased from 39 to 65; otherwise they're left alone. <em>But</em> note that 8th level fighters usually get pretty good battle potions from Smarter Potions.
<li>Cult Archers: originally 8th level thief archers, they're changed into 8th level fighters (more hit points and better battle potions).
<li>Cult Assassins: 8th level fighter/thieves. They get extra hit points and a stack of Invisibility potions (they'll only use them if you have Improved General AI installed).
<li>Cult Wizards: originally 3rd level wizards (in practice), they become 8th level and get Wands of Paralysis (a surprisingly nasty weapon in BG1).
<li>Cult Enforcers: in the original game they're actually listed as high-level fighter-mages, but they don't use any of their fighter-mage powers. I take their classification seriously: they are now 15th/15th level fighter-mages, though with only L5 spells and below, and they use their Wands of Frost. These guys are very dangerous.
</ul>
The demon Aec'Letec isn't modified (it's already seriously dangerous) but Tracea Carrol, previously a weakling wizard (c. L6), is now 11th level. In addition, the six cultists from whom Aec'Letec draws strength will now defend themselves. All in all, this makes the final battle with Aec'Letec pretty tough. I recommend the use of Arrows of Dispelling on your own party to dispel Aec'Letec's Death Gaze.
 <p><strong><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>Improved miscellaneous encounters.</strong></p>
 The full list is:
<ul>
<li>Laurel the paladin's gibberling hunt. As it stands this is a ridiculous encounter - the "horde" of gibberlings is tiny. I've quadrupled their number - it's still not a difficult fight, but it's a more realistic one.
<li>Cythandria, Sarevok's paramour, is currently guarded by a pair of hopeless ogres; they're replaced by Stone Golems.
<li>Slythe the assassin gains a level (which brings his backstab into quadruple-damage territory). He also slugs a potion of invulnerability, and receives a Non-Detection spell, before the battle starts.
<li>Jenkal, the halfling traitor in Gullykin, is currently a 4/4 fighter/thief. I raise her to 6/6 and give her some potions of invisibility. Jenkal will flee if badly hurt and will turn up again later in the game. More seriously, the secret passage in Jenkal's home is now blocked, requiring you to go the long way through Firewine Bridge to reach the Ogre Mage.
<li>Hairtooth and Gnarl, the half-ogres at the bridge to the gnoll fortress, become 5th level fighters and get an appropriate (18/95) strength score.
<li>Sunin (the randomly encountered mage in a house in Baldur's Gate) is raised to 11th level.
<li>Tamoko's level is increased to 14, so she's slightly more of a speed bump to end-of-game-level parties.
<li>The "amazon" group of assassins gain one level each. (This is really just to make them immune to Sleep.)
</ul>
<a name="chapterbattle" id="chapterbattle"></a>
<p><strong>Tougher chapter-two end battle</p></strong>

<p>
This is the fight with Mulahey at the bottom of the Nashkel Mine.<p>
Mulahey's hit points are improved, and he gets some Strength of One spells and scripting to use them. Mulahey's tough kobold allies are redesignated as "Kobold Elites" and improved a bit. The allies that he summons later in the fight are beefed up a bit too.
<p>If "Dark Side based kobold upgrade" is installed, the kobold elites get poisoned daggers and the summoned allies include some kobold guards.

<p><strong>Tougher chapter-three end battle</p></strong>


<p>
This is the fight with the Iron Throne adventurers in Tazok's tent.<p>
Britik the gnoll gets a strength potion and a slight level increase. A few Black Talons and Chill are added to the tent.
<p>Most importantly, if you talked your way into the bandit camp, by the time you get out you'll find that Taugosz has smelled a rat, and you may have
to fight your way out. And if you storm the camp, the Iron Throne adventurers won't be content to wait for you - they'll come out and attack.
<p>

<p><strong>Tougher chapter-four end battle</p></strong>


<p>
The confrontation with Davaeorn at the bottom of the Cloakwood mine. 
<p>The battle horrors, instead of being summoned by traps, are there already. They're enchanted to be immune to fire, lightning and web (I'm following pen-and-paper rules here, more or less.)
<p>More importantly, <em>if</em> the Smarter Mages component is installed, Davaeorn benefits from it: he has a modified script which combines features of his original teleport-around script with the Smarter Mages script.

<p><strong>Tougher chapter-five end battle</p></strong>


<p>
The six acolytes are left alone (though if you are using the Smarter Mages/Priests/general AI components you'll notice a big effect). However, they are joined by two new acolytes: a half-elven fighter/thief and a human thief, who begin the battle invisible. You get some warning of the change if you read the dialogues lower down the tower carefully.
<p><strong>Tougher chapter-six end battle</p></strong>


<p>
Each adventurer in Prat's party gains two levels. The party starts the battle invisible and supported by a couple of air elementals.
<p><strong><a name="endbattle" id="endbattle"></a>Improved final battle.</strong></p>
<p>
Sarevok and his three acolytes (Tazok, Angelo, Semaj) are joined by a fourth: Diarmid, who the party briefly encounter at the very end of chapter 6. He's a fighter/mage rather like Angelo.
<p>
More crucially, Sarevok is the beneficiary of a spell which lets him draw protective strength from his followers. You won't even be able to hurt him until at least one is dead, and killing him requires all four to have died. (Not terribly original, I admit, but in the original battle you might as well just ignore everyone else and go straight for Sarevok. This way it's a proper fight against a <em>team</em> of opponents. And hopefully the added dialogue is smooth enough not to make it feel contrived.)
 </div>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<div class="section">If you have the "<acronym
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym> have potions" component installed,
  you'll find that occasionally potions turn up in random places, usually on
  the bodies of people who are killed by scripts. This is because the potions
  component works by adding code to the "generic" scripts that all enemies use,
  and sometimes <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> randomly gives that
  script to someone who isn't actually going to fight you. I've caught this wherever
  I can but I'm sure some exceptions slipped through - let me know if you find
  any.
  <p>Some people have reported that the "Allow player to choose <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> proficiencies
    and skills" component is a bit erratic on occasion, particularly if you do
    things like going to the level-up screen and then escaping out of it again.
    I can't reproduce this locally but let me know if you encounter it. </p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2> 
<div class="section">Firstly, many thanks to Gibberlings Three, and CamDawg in
  particular, for hosting!
  <p>Huge thanks of course to Westley Weimer, who created an astonishingly flexible
    and powerful mod editor for <acronym 
title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games; and to the creators of <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> for perhaps the greatest mod
    ever, which has breathed new life into <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>. Many thanks also to the creators of the <a 
href="http://iesdp.gibberlings3.net/">Infinity Engine Structure Description Project</a>,
    which clarified what the hell was going on several dozen times; and to Jon
    Hauglid, for Near Infinity - it was such an elegant and straightforward editor
    to use, I didn't need any other;</p> 
  <p>I'm grateful to the authors of the Dark Side of the Sword Coast mod for
    the fragments of their mod I borrowed for the kobold upgrade. And I'm hugely
    grateful to Hannah Wallace, who playtested this whole thing with me (it began
    as a series of upgrades to make our own game more interesting, actually)
    and put up with a ridiculous number of comments like "that was too easy,
    do you mind if I rewrite it?"...</p> 
  <p> As of version 3, I'd also like to thank everyone who's playtested <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> and
    reported bugs, but in particular I'd like to thank Berelinde, Shaitan, and
    Lemernis for their detailed comments at various points.</p> 
  <p>As of version 4, I'd like to thank Pro5 and Ronin69hof for their work on
    the port of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> to Baldur's
    Gate Trilogy. Many of the suggestions they made are now incorporated into
    the original version of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>.
    And for the Spanish translation, I'd like to thank Feyd Mandalore, Immortality,
    Eresh Kigal, elvex, danmj2000, Federico Ezequiel Montiel and <a href="http://www.clandlan.net">www.clandlan.net</a>. </p> 
  <p>As of version 5, I'd like to thank Bursk, Coaster, Erebusant Grand_Dracolich,
    Jadefang, KGub, Nythrun, PetrusOctavius, Shaitan, Raven_Song, thetruth, and
    Wanderer for the many bugs they identified. For the Polish translation I'd
    like to thank Nugrud; for the German translation, Leonardo Watson.</p> 
  <p>As of version 6, <strong>huge</strong> thanks (again) to Pro5 and Ronin69hof
    - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> couldn't have been made <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>-compatible
    without their earlier translation.</p>
    <p>As of version 9, I've lost track of all the various people who've contributed bug reports and content suggestions - but thank you all! Thanks also to ClanDLAN and the d'Oghmatiques for the Spanish and French translations.
    <p>Version 10 owes a huge amount to Taimon, who wrote and maintained an unofficial hotfix to version 9 during a two-month period when I wasn't around. More than half the content of v10 is directly taken from that hotfix.</p>

<h2>Version History</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>V1: Initial release 21st July 2006</p> 
  <p>V1.02: Version history added(!) Spider bug fixed (hopefully) following Macready's
    worry</p> 
  <p>V1.03: Note added to README about the few-second delay in <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> hit points being correct after Choose
    Your Own Proficiencies. Minor upgrade to <acronym 
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> after MacReady's comments.</p> 
  <p>V1.04: Silke altered so she doesn't attack her own summoned creatures. Ogre
    magi changed to class "mage" so their spells aren't cast at <acronym title="Level 1">L1</acronym>; magetop.baf
    and magecore.baf altered to reflect this.</p> 
  <p>V1.05: Various bugs picked up after a new walkthrough test:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Wolf of Ulcaster correctly placed </li> 
    <li>Leaving Tazok's tent is now party-required </li> 
    <li>Warning that Tazok's tent is shut displays at the right time </li> 
    <li>Wizards and others who drink invisibility potions now admit to it </li> 
    <li>Loophole in Kaishas dialog fixed </li> 
    <li>Daese now goes hostile </li> 
    <li>Ogre mage in ambush only drops one letter </li> 
    <li>Sarevok correctly receives his min-hp ring </li> 
    <li>Angelo is correctly marked as hostile </li> 
    <li>Sarevok banter slowed a bit </li> 
    <li>Sarevok flunkies correctly use magic items </li> 
    <li>Restored fire resistance to Sarevok flunkies, since discovering that
      exploding arrows pierce <acronym 
  title="Minor Globe of Invulnerability">MGI</acronym> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>V1.06: It turns out <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> doesn't
    like to play with other mods that add bytes to .cre files (the Walking Speeds
    component of TutuFix, notably). The new version dynamically checks where
    the bits of the .cre file we want to overwrite are, rather than doing it
    blind.</p> 
  <p>Under the hood change: we use ALWAYS to install <acronym 
title="Detectable Spells">DS</acronym> (bypassing the need to put STATS.IDS in
    the install by force rather than by <acronym 
title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>) and deprecate the <acronym 
title="Detectable Spells">DS</acronym> component.</p> 
  <p>It turns out that arrows of detonation bypass <acronym 
title="Minor Globe of Invulnerability">MGI</acronym>, so we replace Diarmid's
    arrows with Arrows of Dragon Venom. And we give the <acronym title="Chapter 6">C6</acronym> Diarmid a min-hp ring
    so he reliably makes it to <acronym title="Chapter 7">C7</acronym>.</p> 
  <p>Minsc (and hypothetical other rangers) now correctly gets 2-weapon proficiencies
    at start.</p> 
  <p>V1.07: Changed numbering system (from v.x to v.1.0x). Improved mage <acronym 
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> a little, so that they finish off
    helpless parties more efficiently. <br /> 
    Removed a bug whereby <acronym title="Level 4 to 5">L4-5</acronym> mages get infinite numbers of healing potions. <br /> 
    Daitel and the skeleton warriors are now unturnable. <br /> 
    Compatibility fix: Mur'neth now appears in the Nashkel mines even if <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> is
    installed after Mur'neth. <br /> 
    Language fix: to my embarrassment it turns out that "stratagems" doesn't
    have "strategy" as a root, so I'm misspelling it.</p> 
  <p>V2 (16th August 2006): Added flags to each component, so other mods can
    detect them. <br />
    Generic <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> undergoes a
    significant overhaul to try to reduce stuttering. <br /> 
    Minor bugfix to the mage script: it now deals correctly with solo adventurers
    using protection-from-magic. <br /> 
    Potions of freedom now block Hold Person (only if EasyTutu not in use). <br /> 
    Detectable spells moved into component 1. <br /> 
    Various codings made cleverer (detectable spells now dynamically adds scripting
    states rather than overwriting files, the Ulcaster wolf is added to the .are
    file by detecting where it's supposed to go rather than guessing no-one else
    has altered the code, various creatures who are given items get them through
    ADD_CRE_ITEM rather than the outdated overwrite, <acronym 
title="Protection from Normal Missiles">PNM</acronym> blocks magic missiles rewritten
    to do less overwriting and generally be more intelligible) <br /> 
    Resar, Yago and the Queen in Durlag's Tower are now built from a version
    of Kysus in the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> directory
    rather than from the local one (in case someone alters it). <br /> 
    Creatures whose hit points are boosted now get code to make sure they don't
    accidentally lose hit points if TheBigg's max-hp patch from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks is
    installed. <br /> 
    Code is borrowed from <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to make the "move <acronym 
title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>" patch a bit more future-proofed. <br /> 
    Move-<acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> and Wait-at-inns
    components now don't install if the equivalent <acronym 
title="Baldur's Gate">BG1</acronym> <acronym 
title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> components are installed. <br /> 
    Redundancy corrected: level changes for mages are now made only in component
    1, not duplicated in "Smarter Mages". <br /> 
    Prat's elementals start non-hostile, so they don't attack before Prat does. <br /> 
    Druid alignment shift is deprecated, since it's covered in Divine Remix. <br /> 
    Bandit scalp part of stackable-items deprecated, since it's covered in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks. <br /> 
    Readme is put into <acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym> format.</p> 
  <p>V2.01 (18th August 2006): Fixed some incompatibilities causing <acronym 
title="Crash to Desktop">CTD</acronym> if Walking Speeds from TutuFix installed
    before <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym><br /> 
    Added support for Indira, Mur'neth and Finch to the Wait-at-Inns and Choose-Skills
    components <br /> 
    Marked Gretek-go-hostile not to install if EasyTutu is installed <br /> 
    Modified Smarter <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> and
    Better Calls for Help for increased compatibility with EasyTutu. <br /> 
    Added Goodberries and Mage Armour to Ease-of-use <acronym 
title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>. </p> 
  <p>V2.02 (25th August 2006):Fixed the problem with Indira, Mur'neth and Finch
    being required by the Choose-Skills component <br /> 
    Bassilus's buffing no longer affects the party. <br /> 
    Spiders (including Huge Spiders and Ettercaps) react more intelligently to
    enemies caught in webs <br /> 
    Gibberling hunt now unfolds over a slightly longer period of time <br /> 
    Clerics attack people they hit with Command <br /> 
    More under-the-hood changes: hopefully the last "blind" looks at hex codes
    have now been smartened </p> 
  <p>V3 (10th October 2006): Mages really declare that they've used potions of
    invisibility now <br /> 
    Tweakpack Montaron-as-assassin no longer clashes with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> choose-proficiencies
    (really now, I hope) <br /> 
    Andris's goons really go hostile now <br /> 
    Stuttering effect on chessboard fixed <br /> 
    Archers finish off charmed opponents more efficiently <br /> 
    Mage, Priest and general <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> modified to almost-completely-eliminate the annoying
    delay when they're created <br /> 
    Problem with the Ardrouine quest fixed (Smarter Calls for Help no longer
    overwrites the scripts for "worgar") <br /> 
    A couple of problems cleaned up with the Mulahey fight (kobolds now go hostile
    more reliably; Mulahey doesn't buff the party) <br /> 
    Hobgoblins in the <acronym title="Chapter 3">C3</acronym> end fight go hostile more reliably now. <br /> 
    Davaeorn's battle horrors no longer turn on him <br /> 
    Slythe and Krystin no longer chase invisible foes indefinitely <br /> 
    Mirror of Opposition creatures now created via Simulacrum <br /> 
    Ease-of-Use <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> now stops repeatedly casting Armor, correctly uses Goodberries,
    avoids combat when turning undead, and doesn't inappropriately reference "wesalac". <br /> 
    Tazok correctly becomes undead on death. <br /> 
    Sarevok and co. successfully chase the party. <br /> 
    Corsone no longer attacks his own summoned creatures. <br /> 
    New component added: smarter deployment for Drakar's adventurers and the
    Amazons. <br /> 
    New component added: Shar-Teel no longer gets killed in her challenge fight. <br /> 
    Major under-the-hood change: a number of more complicated scripts are now
    written in "<acronym title="Stratagems Scripting Language">SSL</acronym>" (Stratagems Scripting Language, an experimental metalanguage
    for writing <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>) and compiled in advance (not at run-time). This shouldn't
    be visible to players at all. </p> 
  <p>V4 (December 2006) <br /> 
    Spanish translation added, courtesy of ClanDLAN <br /> 
    Mage and priest scripts revamped for code optimisation and to allow area-effect
    spells to be targetted on improved-invisible targets; priest core is now
    written in <acronym title="Stratagems Scripting Language">SSL</acronym>. <br /> 
    TP2 modified for code optimisation, incorporating various modifications to
    the Baldur's Gate Trilogy version by Pro5. <br /> 
    Fine weapons component rewritten, for code-optimisation purposes and to incorporate
    Miloch's suggestion that it should be optional whether fine weapons break. <br /> 
    Order of some scripts altered (for chessboard bishops, and for Islanne and
    Kiel doppelgangers) so as to avoid clashes with the new optimised mage and
    priest scripts. In the process the bishop is given a new move-to-<acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> script. <br /> 
    Bugfix in general <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>: stupid creatures like skeletons now use missile weapons
    if they have them. <br /> 
    Minor bugfix in stackable-pelts component: the Nashkel merchant now only
    takes one pelt at a time. <br /> 
    Typo corrected: wyverns now respond correctly to calls for help. <br /> 
    Giant spiders now have a less poisonous, but more paralysing, bite. <br /> 
    Ease-of-use <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> now uses SimDing's improved Goodberries correctly. <br /> 
    Chainmail removed from Fuernebol doppelganger: he now uses spells correctly. <br />

    the first time. <br /> 
    Neira removed from the Amazons <br /> 
    Montaron-and-Xzar-vanish bugfix should now work correctly </p> 
  <p>V5 (July 2007) <br />

    Taugosz stutter bug in EasyTutu fixed <br />

    Changed an 0x28 to an 0x38 in the "replace magic weapons" component - doesn't
    seem to have done any harm yet though <br /> 
    Hopefully it's now harder to draw Sarevok's minions forward <br /> 
    Mages and priests now deal better with undead summons <br /> 
    Dynaheir's split-pair dialogue no longer assumes the player is male <br /> 
    Flesh golems no longer get potions <br /> 
    Wyverns move to a longer-range help script, hopefully solving problems with
    some wyverns not coming forward <br /> 
    Streamlined Andris's retreat-and-heal script, to avoid accidental minhp1-cheese <br /> 
    Hobgoblins and humans now use the same SHOUT code, so that the hobgobs in
    the Cloakwood help the Throne humans <br /> 
    Several Iron Throne guards with dialog (notably the Cyric-worshipper) no
    longer respond to help calls and so break their dialog <br /> 
    Davaeorn's battle horrors moved so as not to come forward before Davaeorn
    speaks <br />

    Slythe gives feedback of his buffs <br /> 
"Choose <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> proficiencies" component now displays its warning explanation in
the text box, not above characters' heads, and it doesn't attribute the warning
to the character. (This is in response to Kulyok's worry about fourth-wall-breakage) <br /> 
    Increased experience for killing kobold shamans <br /> 
    Added "remove spells not in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>" component <br /> 
    Relabelled all components in the TP2 <br /> 
    Spellcasters' fake-see-invisibility tightened up: they no longer keep concentration
    when casting individual-target spells at a target who goes invisible partway
    through, and they no longer attack invisible opponents. <br /> 
    Priests don't hang back from melee if the whole party is helpless. <br /> 
    Davaeorn doesn't bother with his teleporting routine against a single opponent </p> 
  <p>V6 (September 2007) <br /> 
    <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> compatibility: <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> now
    installs on both <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate One To Two">BG1Tutu</acronym> and

Tweak to Ulcaster Wolf sound effects.<br>

Allow the Iron Throne group in the bandit camp to hear if the alarm is sounded.<br>
Division between "detectable spells" and "detectable items" now works properly.<br>
Diggers are now corrected to be 1st level; previously they were 6th level despite having 4 hit points, which was confusing the "drink potions" script.<br>

<b>Minor new components, and minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b> <br>
Added the mirror-image and dispel-magic fixes from SCSII (both are actually written by Taimon; I'm just giving them a home)<br>
Slight tweak to mage melee script, to block a situation where a mage with Sleep spells only doesn't go to melee against characters of >4th level <br>
Recommended install order tweaked to remove the implication that SCS should be installed before BG2 mods<br>
Harder spiders moved into "tactical challenges" component<br>
Bassilus's level decreased from 12 to 10<br>
Borda is changed to 6th level (he's listed as being 9th level, but this is probably an error and makes him overpowered)<br>
Mages and priests now avoid hitting undead with spells that don't affect them<br>
Priests' turning streamlined<br>
Added the insect-plague and stoneskin tweaks from SCSII (the latter is actually written by Taimon)<br>
Replaced the SCS ease-of-use AI with the SCSII version<br>
A few misc. changes to streamline compatibility between SCS and SCSII (for BGT users)<br>
Silke no longer prebuffs<br>
Mages now use Protection from Magic Weapons, Improved Haste, Spook, and Blindness<br>

Zargal in BGT no longer gets a TUTU potion<br>

Under-the-hood rearrangement of the way combat scripts are assigned to generic enemies (should improve BGT compatibility and mesh better with BG1NPC)<br>
Hobgoblins and humans no longer use the same help scripts (specific hobgoblins who ought to respond to throne shouts now get modified individually)<br>
Taugosz now goes hostile in response to Venkt's death, not to the party starting chapter 4 (this is more robust against the party just not picking up the relevant scroll)<br>
Phase spiders and doppelgangers no longer use their abilities when asleep or otherwise disabled<br>
Andarthe (from BG1NPC) now goes hostile correctly<br>
Blocked a possible situation in which Davaeorn's battle horrors attack him<br>
Tutu magic weapons are now flagged correctly as enchanted (this is relevant for fighting certain summoned creatures from BG2, e.g. elementals) and a few creatures from SCS (Cythandria's stone golems, Prat's air elementals) are now once again immune to +1 or lower-powered weapons<br>
Phase spiders hopefully no longer jump to dead opponents<br>
Under-the-hood change: the NPC proficiency component now uses EXTEND_TOP instead of EXTEND_BOTTOM, in the hope that this will lead to fewer glitches<br>
Added missing documentation for the "lite" Protection-from-Normal-Missiles component<br>
Player-controlled undead now behave less glitchily when turned<br>
"antimagic now penetrates invisibility" component was corrupting the descriptions of the spells, due to an SCS/SCS2 difference I wasn't allowing for; corrected<br>
An error in the cross-platform code (carried over from BG1NPC) was causing Imoen's script to be incorrectly updated; this meant that the "set NPC proficiency" component wasn't working for Imoen on BGT installs. (Fixed; thanks to Taimon for identifying the problem.)<br>
Fixed a typo that was causing slimes to be incorrectly flagged by the fix component<br>
Fix component now makes the doors of Sarevok's temple impassable by NPCs (this was occasionally breaking the final battle)<br>
Fixed various problems in the shapeshift component<br>
Fixed a TUTU-specific bug (caused by a subtle difference between TUTUv4 and Easytutu) that was preventing the final movie from playing<br>
Skeleton warriors in BG1 are listed as "human", to make them immune to turning. They're now listed as undead and made immune to turning directly.<br>
Improved Minor Encounters no longer fails to install if Smarter Mages is not installed<br>
Fear now correctly affects enemies<br>
BG1NPC and SCS were both trying to fix a compatibility problem (caused by killing Tazok) and the two fixes were themselves incompatible! SCS now uses the BG1NPC fix<br>

The number of Kobold shamans in the ambush has been reduced from 2 to 1<br>
Carrion-crawler help scripts should now work<br>
Fixed a typo in the spider scripts that was preventing their web-spinning being blocked in some locations<br>
Andris now initiates dialogue in BGT installs<br>
Andarthe (from BG1NPC) now summons wolves correctly in BGT installs<br>
Fixed typo in the code for the Avenger kit<br>
Fixed a serious bug which was making it impossible to sneak into the bandit camp<br>
The Warders in Durlag's Tower no longer cast spells when stunned (etc)<br>
Enemies with throwable weapons now use them (previously, a game-engine problem with the EquipRanged() command prevented them<br>
Caught a collection of small typos noticed by Temujin<br>
Fixed a typo in the (non-improved Shapeshift) Avenger shapeshift script<br>
C3 bandits, and moved assassin group, no longer get an accidental immunity to charm magic<br>

Under-the-hood change: "Faster Bears" now edits Creature files, not scripts (thanks to Ardanis for the code)<br>
<b>Bugfixes (thanks to Ilyich and Temujin in particular for these)</b>   <br>
Fixed a typo in the no-chunk code that was preventing it from working properly<br>
Blocked a bug that, in rather rare circumstances, would cause mages to recover their spells upon going out of sight<br>
Fixed a typo in Improved Drasus Party, Improved Iron Throne Assassins, Improved Minor Encounters, and Improved Balduran's Isle
that was preventing those components from being installed except on the same install runthrough that installed 
Smarter Mages (thanks to Wisp for catching this)<br>
Fixed an incompatibility with the newest version of EasyTutu that was causing Baresh to summon a Dark Planetar(!)<br>
Tidied up various confusions between SCSI and SCSII version of global macro library ("scsii.tph")<br>
The tourist in Durlag's Tower is no longer immune to the trap (thanks to 10thLich for catching this)<br>
Updated general AI to use SCS2 code for thieves (main change: thieves who can't see you no longer go invisible)<br>
Kobold component now installs even if "smarter general AI" isn't installed<br>

Fixed a typo that was breaking compatibility with SR<br>
Smarter Priests no longer breaks Jaheira's BG1NPC quest<br>
Belgin (from BG1NPC Tiax quest) now included in Smarter Priests<br>
<p>V16 (September 2010)</p>
<b>New or heavily modified content</b>  <br>
New Russian translation (courtesy of Prowler at the Arcane Coast)<br>
<b>Bugfixes</b>                             <br>
Corrected a potentially serious bug in the v15 version of the "make_casting_innate" macro (this had the potential to cause a variety of crashes and glitches)<br>
Revamped the hostile copies of the party summoned by the Mirror of Opposition, using a method worked out and coded by Ardanis. It should all work much more smoothly, and be more bug-resistant and compatibility-friendly, now;
it will also be slightly harder, as clones of party spellcasters no longer lose their highest-level spells<br>
Fixed a (TUTU-specific) problem with the Faster Bears component that was causing crashes<br>
<p>V17 (February 2011)</p>
<b>New or heavily modified components</b>
<ul>
<li>New component: make spell sequencers schoolless
<li>New component: slower reputation increase

<li>New component: more realistic wolves and dogs
<li>"Allow antimagic spells to penetrate Improved Invisibility" component now has a single-target option
<li>ToBEx integration: version Beta 0019 of ToBEx installs automatically as part of "Initialise" component
</ul>
<b>Minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Priests now cast low-level healing spells as part of Ease-of-Use AI (thanks to TheBigg for code)
<li>Instituted scs.ini, basically as a way to incorporate specialised requests without messing up the mod's overall structure too much
<li>Consolidated various fixes into an "initialise" component that also installs Detectable Spells and ToBEx
<li>Moved detectable items back into the main Initialise component (this can be overridden via scs.ini)
<li>Under-the-hood change: some old macros updated to properly allow for the possibility of spells with extended effects
<li>Under-the-hood change: Ease-of-Use AI recoded to use SSL
<li>Updated Detectable Spells to be the same as SCSII v16
<li>Spiderwebs are now single-target
<li>Updated to WEIDU v227
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Priest spellcasting is no longer prevented by effects that give mages a casting-failure chance (this was causing problems in mods that allow armour to be worn by mages with spellcasting failure chances)
<li>Creatures with slings and shields now fight correctly
<li>Change to smarter general AI: Enemies should no longer be able to locate players they've never seen yet [technical detail: change to chase.ssl]
<li>Oozes and jellies no longer lose their ranged attacks
<li>Chapter 3 assassins should now spawn a bit more reliably
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Slightly esoteric compatibility fix: the "mage_smart_clones", "mage_alacrity" and "mage_make_timestop" macros no longer choke on spells with an extended header (thanks, Galactygon)
</ul>
<p>V18 (March 2011)</p>
<b>New or heavily modified components</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated German and French translations (French translation was actually silently updated between v17 and v18)
<li>Linux compatibility (thanks to TheBigg)
</ul>
<b>Minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Under-the-hood change: slight recoding of SSL to avoid some glitches (again, thanks to Wisp for suggesting this)
<li>Under-the-hood change: a copy loop in Better Calls for Help was missing a BUT_ONLY, and so was creating unnecessary copies of files
<li>Updated to WEIDU v229
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The fix to Spell Shield no longer changes the power level of antimagic spells (this was slightly reducing the effectiveness of Spell Thrust and (on an SR install) Secret Word)
<li>Mages no longer go invisible when blinded
<li>I was accidentally using "dw#ranged" instead of "dw#range" for an intermediate file, which was causing (slightly esoteric) bugs in some installs
<li>Help scripts no longer cause party-charmed creatures to return to being hostile (silent fix, 24 hrs after release)
<li>Thanks to Galactygon, fixed the bug where antimagic didn't work properly for people playing without ToBEx (silent fix, 24 hrs after release)
<li>Thanks to TheBigg, non-Windows users playing on a Windows emulator still get ToBEx (silent fix, 24 hrs after release)
<li>Supplied a missing string that was choking Linux installs (hopefully this won't actually be relevant given the above fix, except for a minority of Mac users) (silent fix, 24 hrs after release)
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>If Spell Revisions v3 (but not v4) is installed, the area-effect assigned to certain antimagic spells is reverted if you choose the non-area-effect
version of "allow antimagic to penetrate invisibility"
<li>Slower Reputation component no longer chokes if other mods have corrupted scripts, and generally runs a bit more smoothly (thanks to TheBigg for help coding this)
<li>Fixed a compatibility problem with Spell Revisions and the Spell Shield Fix (silent fix, 72 hours after release)
</ul>
<p>V19 (April 2011)</p>
Updated French and Italian translations (fixing an error in previous French translation update)
<p>V20 (November 2011)</p>
<b>Minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Ease of Use AI no longer autocasts Minute Meteors for fighter-mages, bards, and fighter-mage-thieves.</li>
<li>Ease of Use AI no longer breaks Sanctuary to attack.</li>
<li>Love, Pride etc are now fearless.</li>
<li>Mages who wander off screen make more effort to relocate the party.</li>
<li>Slight change in behaviour for the random assassins: they will spawn in city streets, but they won't spawn if the protagonist is invisible.</li>
<li>Monsters can't flee between levels of Ramazith's tower (preventing comical but implausible scenarios).</li>
<li>Archers no longer retreat when they're out of ammo. (Thanks to Polytope for pointing out a nice way to implement this; I've wanted to do it for ages.)</li>
<li>Updated to ToBEx v21. This should fix the problem with magic damage resistance, and should generally increase stability.</li></li></li>
<li>Updated to WEIDU v231.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a variety of crashes and glitches by updating ToBEx</li>
<li>Fixed problem where the code in some places (notably, Smarter General AI) wasn't correctly identifying some creatures as party-joinable (those with DVs longer
than 8 characters were being skipped.)</li>
<li>The "skipping this component as the equivalent ToBEx component" string was missing; it's been added.</li>
<li>The "give fighters better proficiency choices" component no longer confuses NPCs.</li>
<li>"More realistic wolves" no longer runs the risk of breaking Melicamp's quest.</li>
<li>Fixed a glitch in random assassins' scripting that protected them from Charm.</li>
<li>Davaeorn now correctly uses BG1 or BG2 spells, and buffing or no buffing, according to player's choice when installing "smarter mages".</li>
<li>Cythandria's golems are now correctly vulnerable to magic weapons.</li>
<li>Kelddath Ormyr and his Sirines now help each other.</li>
<li>Andris's "monhp1" ring is now a "minhp1" ring, which should reduce the likelihood that he gets confused (and added a Kill-Andris option at the console, just in case he does anyway).</li>
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>We now detect Spell Revisions modifications to the game engine and try to avoid breaking those fixes via ToBEx.</li>
<li>We work around Spell Revisions' replacement of a core-game Stoneskin scroll with Dimension Door.</li>
<li>We give Prat's air elementals immunity to non-magical weapons directly rather than via an item (this guards against the possibility that some other mod changes the protection item).</li>
</ul>
<p>V21 (July 2012)</p>
<b>New or heavily modified components</b>
<li>Updated French and Russian translations.
<ul></ul>
<b>Minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>We make some attempt to respond to offscreen castings of disabling spells.
<li>Updated to ToBEx v23.
<li>Hostile innocents no longer propagate shouts.
<li>Mages only now learn Fireball and Lightning Bolt if there are circumstances in which they are willing to cast them.
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Wolves' scripting is now slightly more robust.
<li>Wolves met as random encounters are now always hostile.
<li>Corrected a bug that was preventing ordinary doppelgangers from  using magical abilities on a BGT install. (Thanks, Ardanis.)
<li>The uncompiled (.pl) version of ssl.pl was a slightly outdated one that failed to fix a couple of script bugs and didn't lowercase files; updated to correct version. (This only affects OSX/Linux users.)
<li>Fixed a number of typos in the English-language version spotted by hook71.
<li>Fixed an under-the-hood bug in C5end.tph, caught by Ardanis (I don't think it could actually show up in game).
<li>We now systematically enforce the requirement that the Initialise component is installed; allowing it not to be causes instabilities when it's uninstalled. (Power users can disable this by putting "dw#detectable.xxx" in the override... but, as Weimer used to say, Don't Do This.)
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<li>Move-Boo components are now properly synchronised across SCS and SCSII.
<ul>
</ul>
