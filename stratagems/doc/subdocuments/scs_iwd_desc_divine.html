<p><h3><a id="SPPR117" name="SPPR117"></a>Cause Light Wounds (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Healing<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: 1/2<br>
<br>
By casting this spell and touching a creature, the priest deals 8 points of damage (save vs. Spell for half) to the creature's body. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.</p></div>

Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 6 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When uttering the Curse spell, the caster lowers the morale of enemy creatures and any Saving Throws and attack rolls they make by 1. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster. Affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR118" name="SPPR118"></a>Sunscorch (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Sun<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes one target of the caster's choice. Any creature struck by the ray takes 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster; however, if the target is an undead creature or a monster vulnerable to bright light, the damage is 1d6, plus 2 points per level of the caster. In addition to sustaining damage, victims are also blinded for 3 rounds. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage and to avoid the blindness.</p></div>
</div><div class="ribbon_rectangle_h2"><h2><a name="LEVEL2" id="LEVEL2"></a>New Level 2 Spells</h2></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>

<p><h3><a id="SPPR217" name="SPPR217"></a>Alicorn Lance (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell creates a silver-hued, partially ethereal lance shaped in the form of an alicorn (a unicorn horn). The caster chooses a target, and the alicorn lance instantaneously fires at it, inflicting 3d6 points of piercing damage with a Save vs. Spell for half. Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it always leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to its Armor Class for 3 rounds.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR218" name="SPPR218"></a>Beast Claw (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell transforms the caster's arms into the claws of a mighty beast, giving the caster 18/72 Strength and the ability to rake an opponent for 2d4 (plus Strength bonus) points of slashing damage. The caster can attack twice per round with the beast claws, with a +2 bonus to hit.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR219" name="SPPR219"></a>Cause Moderate Wounds (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Healing<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: 1/2<br>
<br>
By casting this spell and touching a creature, the priest deals 11 points of damage (save vs. Spell for half) to the creature's body. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR203" name="SPPR203"></a>Chant (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon him/herself and his/her party and causes harm to his/her enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all the priest's allies within the area of effect gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, minimum damage rolls, and Saving Throws. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead. The priest's enemies suffer from the opposite effects.<br>
<br>
Multiple chants are not cumulative. This spell requires a moderate amount of concentration by the caster, so his/her movement is slowed by half.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR216" name="SPPR216"></a>Cure Moderate Wounds (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Sphere: Healing <br>
Range: Touch <br>
Duration: Permanent <br>
Casting Time: 5 <br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature <br>
Saving Throw: None <br>
<br>
By casting this spell and laying his/her hand upon a creature, the priest heals 11 points of wound or other injury damage from the creature's body. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.</p></div>
</div><div class="ribbon_rectangle_h2"><h2><a name="LEVEL3" id="LEVEL3"></a>New Level 3 Spells</h2></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>

Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 8 hours<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
This spell afflicts one creature the priest touches with a disease that saps the target of 5d4 points of Strength. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effects. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR329" name="SPPR329"></a>Cause Medium Wounds (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Healing<br>

Range: 0<br>
Duration: 3 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 3<br>
Area of Effect: 3-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell conjures forth a barrier of floating bones that spin rapidly around the caster, who cannot move for the duration of the spell. Anyone entering the path of the bones takes 1d6 crushing damage and 1d6 slashing damage per round.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR326" name="SPPR326"></a>Cloudburst (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Elemental Water<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 2 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 17-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell brings forth a magical rain that saturates the area of effect. All cold- and fire-dwelling creatures take 2d3 points of magic damage per round. In addition, all creatures in the area have a 50% chance per round of being struck by bolts of lightning that deal 2d6 electrical damage, with a Save vs. Spell for half. Flame Blade, Shroud of Flame, and salamander auras are extinguished by Cloudburst.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR322" name="SPPR322"></a>Exaltation (Abjuration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Healing<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell enables a priest to aid and protect any one being other than the priest. By touch, the caster removes the effects of fear, sleep, feeblemindedness, unconsciousness, and intoxication, as well as berserk and confused states of mind. In addition, the recipient is protected against spells and other attacks that cause these effects for the duration of the spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR330" name="SPPR330"></a>Favor of Ilmater (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Necromantic, Protection<br>
Range: 30 ft.<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
By invoking this spell, the caster switches his/her own life force with that of the recipient, exchanging all physical injuries. The spell will only function if the caster has more Hit Points than the target before the switch is attempted. This switch is permanent until the caster uses normal methods to heal the damage. The exchange can be done from a distance so long as the spell range is not exceeded. Only the Hit Points are exchanged; the caster cannot take on other conditions from the target such as disease, poison, intoxication, and similar afflictions. <br>
<br>
This spell cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters. It has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR327" name="SPPR327"></a>Mold Touch (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Plant<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell infects the creature the caster touches with a rapidly spreading brown mold. If the infected creature fails a Save vs. Spell, the infection is severe and the creature takes magic damage as follows:<br>
<br>
1st round: 4d6 damage<br>
2nd round: 3d6 damage<br>
3rd round: 2d6 damage<br>
4th round: 1d6 damage<br>
<br>
If the Saving Throw is successful, the damage is reduced as follows:<br>
<br>
1st round: 2d6 damage<br>
2nd round: 1d6 damage<br>
3rd round: 1d6 damage<br>
<br>
Each round after the first, the nearest creature within 10 ft. of the victim must make a Save vs. Spell or be infected by the mold at full strength. This process continues until the mold fails to infect a suitable host in time. Creatures already under the effects of the mold cannot contract it again. The brown mold quickly dies once the spell expires.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR323" name="SPPR323"></a>Moonblade (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Combat, Sun<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 2 turns<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from Strength do not apply.<br>
<br>
The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage, plus an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR320" name="SPPR320"></a>Prayer (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Prayer bestows favor on the priest and his/her allies, and curses their enemies. All attacks, damage, and Saving Throws by friendly characters gain a +1 bonus, while enemy attacks, damage rolls, and saves get a -1 penalty. Any creatures within the area of effect when the spell is cast will continue to be affected by the spell when they leave the area, so if the warriors want to chase down that fleeing goblin, the effects of the Prayer will follow them.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR325" name="SPPR325"></a>Spike Growth (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Elemental Earth<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell transforms the surrounding terrain into spiky plants. Any creature entering the area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and 1d4 points of slashing damage every round until the spell expires.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR328" name="SPPR328"></a>Storm Shell (Abjuration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Protection, Weather<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>
Casting Time: 6<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell surrounds the caster with a bright sphere of disruptive energy that moves with him/her. The storm shell increases the caster's resistance to fire, cold, and electrical damage by 50%.</p></div>
</div><div class="ribbon_rectangle_h2"><h2><a name="LEVEL4" id="LEVEL4"></a>New Level 4 Spells</h2></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div><div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>

<p><h3><a id="SPPR421" name="SPPR421"></a>Blood Rage (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 2 turns<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell works only on player characters or allied creatures. When cast, the target of this spell goes berserk, attacking the nearest creature until that creature is dead, then moving on to the next target. While under Blood Rage, the target is immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion, symbol spells, and related effects. In addition, the target gains +2 to hit, +3 to damage, +2 to Strength, +10 to maximum Hit Points, and +2 to his/her movement rate. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and the target cannot benefit from any effect that heals Hit Points. At the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and his/her Strength drops to 3 for 2 turns. Blood Rage cannot affect—and cannot be cast by—creatures of lawful alignment.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR428" name="SPPR428"></a>Cause Serious Wounds (Necromancy)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Healing<br>

<p><h3><a id="SPPR422" name="SPPR422"></a>Cloud of Pestilence (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Combat, Elemental Air<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 4 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
This spell transforms the air in a 12-ft. radius into sickening, grayish mists. The caster and non-living creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud. For every round of exposure to the disease-ridden air, a creature must save vs. Breath or suffer 3 points of magic damage, blindness, and the loss of 3 points of Strength and Dexterity. The blindness and ability score penalties last 1 turn.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR429" name="SPPR429"></a>Giant Insect (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Animal<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 8 hours<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell summons 2-3 boring beetles or bombardier beetles to the caster's side. The beetles will obey the caster until the spell expires or they are slain.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR418" name="SPPR418"></a>Produce Fire (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Elemental Fire<br>
Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 1 round<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: 4-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
When cast, flames erupt from the target point, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage plus 1 point per level of the caster to all creatures within the spell's radius. Creatures will take damage once per round regardless of when they enter the area of effect.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR420" name="SPPR420"></a>Recitation (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_cleric"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: 25-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
By reciting a sacred passage or declaration, the priest invokes his/her deity's blessing upon him/herself and his/her allies while sowing confusion and weakness among his/her enemies. The priest's allies gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls and Saving Throws, and the priest's enemies receive a -2 penalty to the same. Recitation does not nullify a Prayer spell—the two can be cast in tandem, and the effects are cumulative.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR425" name="SPPR425"></a>Smashing Wave (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Elemental Water<br>
Range: 100 ft.<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 9<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell summons a 5-ft. wide wave of water that moves in the direction willed by the caster, striking all in its path with massive force. The wave deals 4d10 points of crushing damage; in addition, struck creatures may be either stunned (25% chance) or knocked unconscious (5% chance) for 2 rounds. If the creature struck makes a successful Save vs. Breath Weapon, the damage is reduced by half and the creature avoids being stunned or knocked unconscious.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR424" name="SPPR424"></a>Star Metal Cudgel (Conjuration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Combat<br>
Range: 0<br>
Duration: 3 turns<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell creates a meteoric iron magical club that deals 1d6+2 points of crushing damage, confers a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and is treated as a +4 weapon for purposes of what it can hit. Strength, proficiency, and specialization bonuses and penalties apply normally. The club deals an additional 2d6 points of crushing damage against unnatural creatures (undead, elementals, golems, outer-planar creatures, etc.).</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPPR419" name="SPPR419"></a>Static Charge (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description_druid"><p>Sphere: Weather<br>

Casting Time: 9<br>

Static Charge is similar to Call Lightning, except it can be used indoors. This spell allows the caster to generate a static charge around any creature within the area of effect, dealing 2d8 points of electrical damage plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster (save vs. Spell for half). The charge keeps going off once every turn for the duration of the spell.</p></div>
