<p><h3><a id="SPWI126" name="SPWI126"></a>Expeditious Retreat (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 0<br>
Duration: 3 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell doubles the caster's normal speed for a short period of time... usually long enough to escape. Other movement-altering effects, such as Haste and Slow, cannot affect the caster while this spell is in effect. While Expeditious Retreat is active, the caster cannot attack, cast spells, or use any items or special abilities... he/she can only run.</p></div>

Duration: 1 hour/level<br>
Casting Time: 2<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell magically increases a target's Dexterity. The amount depends on the target's class: Rogues gain 1d8 points, warriors and wizards gain 1d6 points, and priests gain 1d4 points. If a character has more than one class, the larger die is used. Cat's Grace cannot raise a target's Dexterity past 20.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI226" name="SPWI226"></a>Decastave (Evocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 0<br>

Casting Time: 2<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell creates a staff of force in the caster's hand. It is treated as a magical weapon, doing 1d6 Hit Points of damage per hit, and it can hit creatures that require +1 weapons to hit. It is a staff, however, so if the caster does not have a proficiency in staff weapons, then the Decastave is used at a penalty. The staff also has the power to drain a target of 1d2 Hit Points on every strike. These Hit Points are added to the caster's, but they can only heal damage the caster has taken; they will not raise his/her Hit Points beyond his/her normal maximum.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI225" name="SPWI225"></a>Snilloc's Snowball Swarm (Evocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>

Casting Time: 2<br>
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: 1/2<br>
<br>
This spell causes a flurry of snowballs to erupt from a point within range. These snowballs will hit everything within the area of effect, doing 1d3 points of cold damage per level, up to a maximum of 8d3 points at level 8. Against fire-using or fire-dwelling creatures, it inflicts 1d6 points of cold damage per level, up to a maximum of 8d6 points at level 8.</p></div>

Duration: 1 round/2 levels<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: 1 creature<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
This spell turns a target's blood to flame, doing 3d4 Hit Points of damage every round and driving the victim berserk with pain. The target gets to save vs. Spell every round; if successful, the damage and berserk state are negated. This spell does not work against undead or extraplanar creatures that do not have blood (such as elementals). If the creature is resistant to fire, this resistance will lower or nullify the damage from this spell.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI426" name="SPWI426"></a>Emotion, Courage (Enchantment/Charm)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>

This spell creates the emotion of courage within the area of effect. All creatures affected by the spell gain +1 to hit, +3 to their damage rolls, and +5 temporary Hit Points (which can put them above their maximum Hit Points). This spell nullifies all fear effects within the area of effect at the time of casting.</p></div>

Duration: 5 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>

<p><h3><a id="SPWI411" name="SPWI411"></a>Emotion, Hopelessness (Enchantment/Charm)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 1 turn<br>

<p><h3><a id="SPWI407" name="SPWI407"></a>Monster Summoning II (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 20 ft.<br>
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>

<p><h3><a id="SPWI429" name="SPWI429"></a>Mordenkainen's Force Missiles (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: 2-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th—in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, to a maximum of five missiles at 19th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 2-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster—for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI432" name="SPWI432"></a>Shadow Monsters (Illusion/Phantasm)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 1 round/level<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell shapes material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary monsters. Up to six shadowy creatures can be summoned at once, but their total Hit Dice will normally not exceed the spellcaster's level.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI430" name="SPWI430"></a>Shout (Invocation)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 0<br>
Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing him/her to emit an earsplitting roar from his/her mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 4d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI431" name="SPWI431"></a>Vitriolic Sphere (Conjuration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: Special<br>
Casting Time: 4<br>
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.<br>
<br>
The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.</p></div>

Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Neg.<br>
<br>
This spell causes a creature to burst into flames if it fails a Save vs. Spell. The creature will burn for 2d6 points of fire damage every round, and gouts of flame erupt from the burning target, causing any creatures within 5 ft. to take 1d4 points of fire damage from the flames. Anyone hit by the victim's flames must also make a Save vs. Spell to avoid contracting the shroud themselves. The shroud of flame dissipates if the caster and target are no longer in the same area. This spell is particularly useful in dispersing packs of trolls and frost salamanders.</p></div>

Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell surrounds the caster with an invisible barrier that moves with him/her. This barrier makes the wizard immune to any magical attacks, but it prevents him/her from casting spells.<br>
<br>
Antimagic Shell also dispels deafness and feeblemindedness in the caster.</p></div>

Casting Time: 5<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect. The darts are +3, do 1d4+3 missile damage, and a creature struck by a dart must save vs. Death or take 2d6 magic damage and have its Strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds. Strength reduction is noncumulative, and failing a save while the reduction is in effect will not extend its duration. The caster's weapon proficiency with darts (or lack thereof) has no effect on the darts' chances to hit a target.</p></div>

Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell confers the powers of a lich's touch and a lich's immunities upon the caster. The wizard gains immunity to paralysis and fear while the spell is in effect, and his/her hands glow with an unearthly blue radiance that does 1d10 cold damage to a target and paralyzes them unless a Save vs. Paralysis is made. This spell has no effect on undead.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI610" name="SPWI610"></a>Monster Summoning IV (Conjuration/Summoning)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 20 ft.<br>

This spell fires an orb of cold at a creature that inflicts 1d4+2 points of cold damage per level of the caster. If the target makes its Save vs. Spell, however, they have dodged the orb and avoided all damage.</p></div>

Area of Effect: Special<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
Shades is similar to Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monsters—it allows the caster to shape material from the Demiplane of Shadow into illusionary creatures. These shadows are tougher than the shadows summoned by Shadow Monsters and Demi-Shadow Monsters, and they will obey the caster until the spell expires or they are slain.</p></div>

This spell deals 3d8 magic damage to all living creatures within a 14-ft. radius. Any creatures that die as a result of this damage are obliterated, and their essence is transformed into a 3-Hit-Dice skeleton under control of the caster. Also, for each creature that dies in this manner, the caster receives a +1 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for 1 turn. Soul Eater has no effect on undead, constructs, and elemental creatures.</p></div>

This spell unleashes an acidic downpour on the area of effect, doing 1d4 points of acid damage each round for the first three rounds, 1d6 points for the next three rounds, and 1d8 points for each round thereafter. Moving out of the area of effect does not stop the damage—the acid adheres to the skin, and any creatures in the area of effect when Acid Storm is cast continue to suffer acid damage as long as the spell duration lasts. Creatures make a Save vs. Spell every round after they have been hit by the cloud—if successful, they only take half damage (for that round only).</p></div>

This spell summons a shimmering sword of force that can be mentally wielded by the caster. It strikes as if it were being used by a Fighter at half the level of the caster, and despite the fact it is held in the hand, it can hit creatures anywhere within the sight of the caster. Although the sword has no bonus to attack, it can hit creatures normally hit only by +2 weapons or lower and inflicts 5d6 points of slashing damage with every strike.</p></div>

Area of Effect: The caster<br>

<br>
This spell conjures forth seven magical orbs that float in a ring above the caster's head. Each eye has a defensive and offensive ability, though once either one is used, the eye will lose its power. The powers of each eye are described below.<br>
<br>
Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Charm Person, bringing a humanoid creature under the caster's control for 1 turn (Save vs. Spell negates).<br>
<br>
Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Magic Missile, creating up to 5 missiles (one for every two levels of experience besides the first) that each strike a target for 1d4+1 magic damage.<br>
<br>
Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 3rd-level wizard spell Lightning Bolt, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 10d6) to all creatures in its path.<br>
<br>
Eye of Venom: This eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. The eye can also be expended as the 4th-level priest spell Poison, dealing 20 points of damage to one creature over a period of 20 seconds (Save vs. Poison negates).<br>
<br>
Eye of the Spirit: This eye blocks one instant-death magic attack (Death Spell; Finger of Death; Power Word, Kill; Slay Living; Destruction). The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye's power as the 2nd-level wizard spell Ray of Enfeeblement, dropping a target's Strength to 5 (Save vs. Spell negates).<br>
<br>
Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 4d6 magic damage and deafening creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).<br>
<br>
Eye of Stone: This eye shields the caster from a single petrification attack. It can also be used as the 3rd-level wizard spell Hold Person, rendering humanoids of man-size or smaller immobile for 1 round/level (Save vs. Spell negates).</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI724" name="SPWI724"></a>Suffocate (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: Visual range of the caster<br>
Duration: 4 rounds<br>
Casting Time: 7<br>
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius<br>
Saving Throw: Special<br>
<br>
This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to Armor Class, -4 to hit, -6 to Dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of magic damage per round. A successful Saving Throw negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it can take a round for a character to catch their second wind.</p></div>

Duration: Instant<br>
Casting Time: 1<br>
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc<br>
Saving Throw: 1/2<br>
<br>
Upon uttering the Great Shout, the caster releases a stunning force from his/her mouth in a 17-ft. cone. The Great Shout is extremely taxing and dangerous to the user. The shout drains 2d4 Hit Points from the caster, and he/she must make a Save vs. Spell or fall unconscious for 1 turn. Creatures 5 Hit Dice and under caught within the Great Shout instantly die. All other creatures within the area of effect must save vs. Spell. Those who fail the save are stunned for 2 rounds, deafened for 4 rounds, and suffer 4d12 points of magic damage. Those who make the save are stunned for 1 round, deafened for 2 rounds, and suffer 2d12 points of magic damage.</p></div>
<p><h3><a id="SPWI820" name="SPWI820"></a>Iron Body (Alteration)</h3></p><div class="spell_description"><p>Range: 0<br>
Duration: 2 turns<br>
Casting Time: 8<br>
Area of Effect: The caster<br>
Saving Throw: None<br>
<br>
This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting him/her several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to electricity and poison, 50% resistant to fire, and 25% resistant to crushing damage. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25, and the caster can attack twice per round with iron fists for 2d4 points of damage plus appropriate Strength bonuses.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting his/her movement rate to 25% of his/her normal, and he/she cannot cast spells while Iron Body is in effect.</p></div>
