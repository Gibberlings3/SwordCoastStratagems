<h2><a name="compat" id="compat">Compatibility</a></h2>
<div class="section"> 
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> is
    designed to work with Baldur's Gate II. It should work fine (and has been
    tested) on Baldur's Gate Trilogy, but most of its content is specific to
    the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> part of the game. (For <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> content,
    you might want to look at the original Sword Coast Stratagems). It is not
    designed for Baldur's Gate: Tutu (Tutu players, again, might like to try the original <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym>).</p>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> currently
    requires Throne of Bhaal.</p>
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> attempts
    to be as compatibility-friendly as possible. It should be compatible with
    most quest, item, <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> and
    tweak mods (I don't know of any significant incompatibilities other than those listed below). 

  <p><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> is designed to work with the (<acronym title="The Gibberlings Three">G3</acronym>) <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Fixpack.</strong> I
        very strongly recommend that you install this fixpack first, before any
        other mods but certainly before <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>. It probably installs without the Fixpack (or with Baldurdash)
        but it's designed on the assumption that Fixpack is installed, and odd
        things may happen if it isn't.</p> 

    <p> In general, when installing multiple mods, it matters which order you install them in. A rough guide is:
    <ol>
    <li>The Ascension mod
    <li>The BG2 Fixpack
    <li>Mods which change the spell or item systems
    <li>Mods which add new quests and similar game content
    <li>Mods which add new joinable characters
    <li>Mods which tweak aspects of gameplay
    </ol>
    Within each category, as a rule of thumb you should install older mods first.
    <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> is a tweak mod, so it should be installed towards the end
    of your installation. Ideally, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> prefers to be installed last, but several other recent mods (aTweaks, Rogue Rebalancing, BiggTweaks, BG2 Tweakpack)
        also say "install last" in their readmes. You can <b>generally</b> install any of these listed mods after <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> fairly safely. (In particular, Rogue Rebalancing and aTweaks are designed with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> specifically in mind, and should definitely be installed after <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>). Other mods, and in particular any mods that add new items, really need to be installed before SCS II.
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> is
fully compatible with my Throne of Bhaal content-enhancement mod, Wheels of Prophecy. Install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> after Wheels of Prophecy. (Note: the Wheels of Prophecy Readme says to install SCSII first; this is a typo, ignore it.)
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> has
    slight compatibility issues with Divine Remix. Divine Remix rearranges the
    spellbooks of some potentially-hostile priests and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>, not knowing this, will fail to use their spells effectively.
    This is unlikely to have any significant effect on play, though.</p> 
  <p> If you install "Tougher Sendai" from Oversight then <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>
    will still work, but the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> improvements to Sendai
    (in the Smarter Mages / Smarter Priests component) will be skipped in favour of the Oversight ones. Pick which one you want.
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> should be compatible with Demivrgvs's "Spell Revisions" (SR) mod and Demivrgvs' and Mike1072's "Item Revisions (IR) mod, although as of version 10,
  <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> spellcasters use only 1st-5th level modified spells. I have some minor worries that the Spell Revisions 
  modifications to Glitterdust and Faerie Fire may cause balancing problems for <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> thieves, but there
  shouldn't be a technical problem. SR and IR should be installed <b>before</b><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> (and indeed before most mods). 
  Some SR and IR components overlap  with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> components; these components will be silently skipped on an install of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>.

  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> is
    compatible with some but not all other tactical mods. The following notes
    are hopefully reliable but so far I have only done limited testing; I would
    be very interested to hear feedback from players on whether they are reliable.</p> 
  <h3>Quest Pack</h3> 
  <p>Quest Pack's <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> and creature
    enhancements should be compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>. Install Quest Pack first, then install whichever components
    of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> you
    want: they will override the Quest Pack for the affected creatures. Quest
    Pack still has some content not influenced by <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>: notably, it improves Mummies and Umber Hulks.</p> 
  <h3>Tactics</h3> 
  <p>Compatibility between Tactics and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> depends on the components:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Components which have a direct <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> analogue: common sense applies, only install the ones you
        want. These are: Improved Bodhi, Improved Golems, Improved Irenicus in Hell, Improved D'Arnise Keep, Improved Kangaxx,
        Improved Mind Flayers, Smarter Dragons, Smarter Beholders, Slightly Smarter
        Mages and Liches, Slightly Tougher Demons,
        Streamlined Trolls (which overlaps with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s "Resilient Trolls"), Tougher Druid Grove (the Faldorn part ovelaps with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s) Improved Faldorn, Improved Sahuagin City, and Improved Demon Knights (which
        overlaps with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s Improved Fiends component).</li> 
    <li>Components with no overlap with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>: should be compatible. These are: Improved Ilyich, the Ritual,
         Kuroisan, Red Badge, Lich in the Docks, Fighter/Illusionist
        in the Docks, Improved Crypt King, Improved Nymphs,
         and the kits. Install these <strong>before</strong> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>.</li> 
    <li>The "Improved Maevar" component is incompatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s "Smarter Arcane Spellcasters". Only install one of them.</li> 
    <li>The "Always Toughest Random Spawns" component is basically the same as the toughest setting of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s "Increase difficulty of level-dependent monster groupings" component. I recommend that you use the latter, as it has the same overall effect but is coded in a way that
        will cause fewer problems for <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> and other mods. (The Tactics version is known to cause some (harmless) warnings when installed with some components of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>.)
    <li>Improved Undead is probably not 100% compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>. If you want to try it anyway, it will need to be installed <strong>after</strong> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> (it's the only component of Tactics for which this is true).</li> 
    <li>Tougher Druid Grove may or may not be compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s "Smarter Divine Spellcasters". Try at own risk.</li>
    <li> Tougher Fire Giants appears to be compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>'s "Improved Fire Giant Temple". Install the Tactics version first, and you should find that fire giants get both the Tactics and the
	<acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> upgrades.</li>
  </ul> 
  <h3>Ascension</h3> 
  <p>Ascension is fully compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym>. By default, Ascension enemies use their own scripts instead
      of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> scripts,
      although a number of components change this. (Note in particular that the Ascension "tougher Demogorgon" component is overridden by the "Improved Fiends" component of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>.</p> 
  <p>However, a number of reports suggest that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>  is not compatible with "BP-Ascension", the version of Ascension that ships with the Big Picture.
  I recommend that you use the standard WEIDU version of Ascension (at <a href="www.weidu.org">www.weidu.org</a>) with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>.
  (Users constructing a Big World Project mega-install should probably take advice from <a href="www.shsforums.net">www.shsforums.net</a> on the best strategy.)
  <h3>aTweaks</h3>
  <p>aTweaks is designed to function with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>. It should be installed <em>after</em> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>. (This is an exception to the usual rule that SCSII should be installed last.)</p>
  <h3>Big Picture</h3>
  <p>My impression is that the latest version of Big Picture is largely incompatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>. I suggest installing one or the other.
  <h3>Sword Coast Stratagems I</h3> 
  <p>For the benefit of Baldur's Gate: Trilogy players, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> are designed to be fully compatible. Install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> first,
      then <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>. <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> players
      who want to use <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>-style spellcasting
      (sequencers, Remove Magic, Unholy Blight) right through the trilogy might
      want to experiment in <strong>not</strong> installing the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> mage
      and priest <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>, in which
      case the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> will
      apply to all spellcasters, even the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> ones.
      This is currently untested, though.</p> 
  <h3>Deeper Shadows of Amn</h3> 
  <p>Deeper Shadows of Amn is probably compatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym>. Install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> second.</p> 
  <h3>Improved Battles</h3> 
  <p>Improved Battles compatibility with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> is unexplored. Good results are probably best obtained by
      installing <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> last, but be warned that this may often overwrite Improved
      Battles <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>.</p> 
  <h3>Improved Anvil</h3> 
  <p>Realistically, Improved Anvil is almost completely incompatible with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> on technical grounds (quite aside from the major conceptual
      incompatibility!) Players who really, really want to try it could have
      a go at installing <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> over the top of Improved Anvil (in which case, which one of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems">SCS</acronym> and <acronym title="Improved Anvil">IA</acronym> takes
      precedence will be highly random) or vice versa (in which case, <acronym title="Improved Anvil">IA</acronym> will
      almost always take precedence) but I don't recommend this and I doubt <acronym title="Improved Anvil">IA</acronym>'s
      author does either. </p>

<h2><a name="install" id="install">Installation</a></h2> 
<div class="section">
<h3>Installing the mod</h3>
  <p>To install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>, run it and tell it to
    install in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. (If nothing happens, run "setup-scsii_autoinstall.exe", in your
    BG2 folder.) You should then be offered three ways to install:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>The quick way:</b> Select
  option 1. You will get a short menu offering you the choice of whether or not to install each of the major sections of SCSII, and offering
  you some customisation choices (see below for a full list of choices offered). The mod will then install (it can take a little while - 15-20 minutes is
  typical). After installing, you can change your install by running "setup-scsii.exe", in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.</li>
  <li><b>The standard way:</b> Select option 2, and then select,
  for each component, whether to install it. (There are over 110 components, and one or two of them take a while to install, 
  so it will take a few minutes.) If you want to modify your install later, just run "setup-scsii.exe" again.</li>
  <li><b>The advanced way:</b> Before making a selection, open up "quick-install.ini", in the scsii subfolder of your
  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder, in a text editor, and edit it to select which option you want. Then 
  select option 3. The whole mod will then
  install without further user input. If you want to modify your install later, either run "setup-scsii.exe", or
  uninstall the mod, edit quick-install.ini, and repeat the process.</li>
     </ul>
   <p>You can get back to this menu (or launch it in the first place, if for some reason it doesn't start) by running "setup-scsii_autoinstall.exe" in your BG2 directory. You can also get directly to a
   component-by-component list of options by running "setup-scsii.exe" in your BG2 directory. After installing, you can edit your 
   installation by running "setup-scsii.exe".</p>
     <p>You don't need to start a new game to install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym>, although a small number of components will not function fully
      unless you do.</p>
<p>If you have installed version 16 or later of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>, you should just be able to install this version over the top. However, 
if you have installed an earlier version (v15 or earlier) of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>, <b>you must
completely uninstall (and preferably delete) it before installing this version. </b></p>

<h3>Uninstalling the mod</h3>

   <p>To uninstall the mod, run "setup-scsii_autoinstall.exe" in your BG2 directory, and select option 4.</p>

<h3>What does the "quick" install include?</h3>
<p>
The quick install offers you the choice of whether or not to install each of the main sections of the mod: Spell Tweaks, Item Tweaks, Gameplay and Ease of Use (listed together),
Artificial Intelligence, and Tactical Challenges. By default, it installs all components in each section, but it lets you choose on the following options:
<ul>
<li>Spell Tweaks: "Modify the Harm spell so it does damage rather than reducing target to 1 hp", "Reduce the power of Inquisitors' Dispel Magic".</li>
<li>Item Tweaks: no options.
<li>Gameplay Tweaks: "Increase the price of a licence to practice magic in Athkatla", "Increase the price asked by Gaelan Baele", 
"Make Watchers' Keep accessible between SoA and ToB", "Customise access to strongholds", "Reduce the rate of reputation gain", 
"Treat mages' and priests' High-Level Abilities as innate abilities rather than memorisable spells".</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence: "Potions for NPCs", "Add high-level abilities (HLAs) to mages and priests [all 4]", "Smarter mages", "Smarter priests"</li>
<li>Tactical Challenges: "Improved D'Arnise Keep", "Improved Bodhi", "Party's items are taken from them in Spellhold", "Improved Battle with Irenicus in Hell"</li>
</ul>
(This is basically most (not all) of the components where there are genuine choices as to what settings the component should be installed at, plus one or two 
choices based on my guesses as to what's most useful. I'm open to suggestions from players (though obviously if too many choices get added, the "quick" install gets less quick.)</p>
</p>
<h3>Installing on non-Windows systems</h3>
<p>On Mac OSX, follow the above instructions, except that you should click on setup-scsii.command, and then drop the ".exe" suffixes.
<p>On Linux, usual instructions apply: Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg">weidu.org</a> and extract 
(at least) the WeiDU, weinstall and tolower executables in a $PATH directory (E.G. /usr/bin). Following that, open a terminal,
cd to your BG2 installation directory, run `tolower' and answer Y to both queries. Finally, run WeInstall scsii to install the mod.<p>
<h3>A note on ToBEx</h3>
<p>SCSII ships with ToBEx version 21. If you want to use a more recent version, install it wherever you like - before SCSII or after. Either way, things should work fine. (If you don't know what ToBEx means, ignore this note.)</p>
</div>
<h2><a name="over" id="over">Overview</a></h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>Sword Coast Stratagems II is a collection of mini-mods for Baldur's Gate
    II, affecting both Shadows of Amn and the Throne of Bhaal extension. Like
    its Tutu predecessor, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> is mostly a tactics mod, intended to make the combats in the
    game more challenging and interesting.</p> 
  <p> Since there are a lot of tactics mods out there, of very different styles,
    it's probably simplest to describe the distinctive features of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>. (I don't want to suggest that all of these are automatically
    advantages: there are lots of different styles of play, and different mods
    fit different people.) Some more thoughts of mine on how to assess tactical
    mods can be found <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=11484&amp;hl=">here</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> plays fair.</strong> I've made a fairly sustained effort
          to ensure that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> opponents fight by the rules and don't use powers denied
          to the player (other than obvious things like dragons' breath weapons,
          liches' ability to see through invisibility, etc!) This is probably
          most notable for spellcasters - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> mages don't randomly get uninterruptible spells, improved
          casting time, free Alacrity, or the like. (In fact, I've removed these
          powers from creatures in the vanilla game occasionally, though I haven't
          done so systematically.)</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> is almost pure <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>.</strong> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> mucks around rather little with the core powers of creatures,
          and hardly at all with their abilities, resistances, saving throws
          and the like. Its main focus is on getting creatures to do as much
          as they possibly can with their existing abilities. In particular,
          its targeting is very careful - hopefully you'll almost never see a
          mage do something stupid like cast repeated spells at someone immune
          to that spell.</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> is quite low-key in its changes</strong> Where <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> does modify something other than <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>,
          it usually does so in a relatively undramatic manner - adding a few
          more creatures, giving a creature a couple of other magic powers in
          keeping with powers it's already used, and so forth. It doesn't give
          new ultra-powerful spells to creatures who didn't have any magic before,
          or give creatures massive damage resistances, for instance. (Again,
          there's not necessarily anything wrong with doing this, it's just not
          what <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS

    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> is very customisable.</strong> Feel free to install whichever
          combination of components you like - there is a separate one for each
          major <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> / tactical
          change.</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> is systematic.</strong> I've tried to be very thorough
          in making sure that there aren't "gaps" in its <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> modifications
          - so that all hostile wizards, for instance, and not just some, are
          upgraded.</li> 
    <li><strong><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> tries to be as compatible as possible.</strong> I've done
          the best I can to ensure that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> will install on top of other mods (especially non-tactical
          ones) without causing problems for either. In particular, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
          II</acronym> dynamically alters its scripts to take (some) account
          of new magic items introduced by other mods.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, playing <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> shouldn't exactly feel like a whole new game - it should feel
      like the old game, but with your foes acting much more intelligently and
      realistically.</p> 
  <p>A full installation of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> modifies <strong>most</strong> major villains ("bosses") and
      set-piece combats in the game. The only exceptions (that I can think of)
      are</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The Kuo-Toa prince</li>
    <li>The Rilmani</li> 
    <li>Balthazar</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>(I hope that some of these will be modified in future releases.)
</p>
  <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> makes
    no use of the difficulty slider (except in the "Beholder's lair" upgrade,
    which is borrowed from Quest Pack).</p> 
  <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> also
    contains a number of other small tweaks to the game. Most of these (especially
    the spell and item modifications) are intended to modify the game in small
    ways that are helpful from the point of view of tactical challenge - some
    make the game a little easier, others make it a little harder. I recommend
    that all the spell tweaks are installed since the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripts
    assume that they are present, but it isn't compulsory.</p>
  <p> Finally, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym> contains a few ease-of-use features (notably, an ease-of-use
      player <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script with
      a large number of convenience features) and a few "flavour" features that
      don't really affect gameplay but hopefully aid the feeling of immersion
      in the game world. </p>

<div class="section"> 
  <h3>Core Component: Initialise</h3>
  <p><strong>(Almost all components require this)</strong></p>
  This component does various setup tasks needed by most other components in SCSII. You won't directly notice what it does, but it fixes a few bugs and extends the game's capabilities to allow
  the rest of SCSII to function correctly. (For experts: it installs Detectable Spells and (on Windows installs) ToBEx, makes magic items detectable, modifies weapons so that the script engine can detect their enchantment level,
  fixes the bugged Spell Shield spell, reconfigures area-effect spells so that Mirror Image doesn't block them, and prevents casting from being disrupted by zero-damage attacks.)
  <p>(Advanced users who find my mods slightly too good at detecting items may
  wish to experiment with setting AI_Does_Not_Detect_Items to 1 in scsii/scsii.ini; this isn't recommended, though.)</p>
        <h3>Spell Tweaks</h3>
  <p> These components make rather minor alterations to the spells in the game,
    usually in the interest of game balance or consistency. All changes are fully
    documented in the spell descriptions themselves. Note that while all these
    components are optional, many of the tactical choices made by wizards and
    priests in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> assume that they are installed, so you may notice some slight
    anomalies in enemy behaviour if you don't install them all. </p> 
  <p><strong>Allow Spellstrike to take down a Protection from Magic scroll</strong></p> 
  In the original game, the protective sphere produced by a Protection from Magic
  scroll is completely impenetrable by any spell at all - if you use one, all
  a hostile wizard can do is run away or fight in melee. This component allows
  the most powerful mage anti-magic spell, the 9th level spell Spellstrike, to
  destroy the anti-magic sphere of one of these scrolls. It also allows the anti-magic
  ray of the Hive Mother beholder to destroy the sphere.
  <p><strong>More consistent Breach spell (always affects liches and rakshasas;
      doesn't penetrate Spell Turning)</strong></p>
  <p>Although it isn't documented, the 5th level spell Breach will remove a creature's
    combat protections (such as Stoneskin) even if that creature is protected
    by Spell Deflection, Spell Turning or Spell Trap; it will not, however, affect
    creatures like liches or rakshasas, because they are immune to spells of
    level 5 or below. This component removes both features: Breach now bounces
    off Spell Turning (etc.), but it affects even those creatures immune to "normal" 5th
    level spells.</p> 
  <p> Once this component is installed, the Breach effect of the Wand of Spell
    Striking will behave in exactly the same way as the Breach spell. </p> 
  <p> Enemy wizards will assume Breach works this way (and so won't target characters
    protected by Spell Turning etc with a Breach), even if you don't install
    this component. </p> 
  <p><strong>Antimagic attacks penetrate improved invisibility</strong></p> 
  <p>This component changes those spells which target a creature's spell defences
    (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Secret Word, Spellstrike,
    Ruby Ray of Reversal - but not Breach) so as to allow them to target creatures which are protected by Improved Invisibility.
    The idea of this component is that these spells can now be cast on enemy
    mages who are protected by Improved Invisibility - this makes the Improved
    Invisibility / Spell Immunity: Divination combination less overpowering.</p> 
  <p> Prior to version 16, this component worked by giving the spells a small area of effect. This option remains, as a legacy component, for those who prefer it.</p>
  <p> The antimagic attacks of enemy mages will bypass Improved Invisibility
    even if you don't install this component.</p>
  <p><strong>Iron Skins behaves like Stoneskin (can be brought down by Breach)</strong></p> 
  <p>For some reason the Iron Skins spell, although it appears identical to a
    Stoneskin, counts as a Spell Protection (like Spell Turning) and not as a
    Combat Protection (like Stoneskin). This means that in the unmodded game,
    Breach does not bring down Iron Skins, but (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>)
    Secret Word does. This component relabels Iron Skins as a Combat Protection.</p> 
  <p> Enemy mages will assume that Iron Skins works this way (and so will, <acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>,
    cast Breach at it) even if you don't install this component.</p> 
  <p><strong>Modify the Harm spell so it does damage rather than reducing target
      to 1 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>The Harm spell reduces its target to 1 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> in
    2nd edition <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>; in 3rd
    edition, it does a large amount of damage instead. This component modifies
    Harm to work more like the 3rd edition spell: it inflicts 150 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage,
    with no saving throw, on a successful touch attack. The rationale for this
    is that Harm (especially combined with Critical Strike) is otherwise an almost-instant
    way of eliminating even foes with hundreds of hit points. Harm remains lethal
    in this component, but is not quite so overwhelming.</p> 
  <p> There are two versions of this component. One version modifies only the
    player's version of Harm; the other modifies player and enemy versions alike.
    (The former component is probably more merciful, as rather few characters
    in the party will have more than 150 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> even
    at full strength, at least until very late in the game.)</p>
  <p><strong>Make individual versions of Spell Immunity available, so that players
      can use them in Contingencies etc.</strong></p> 
  <p>Even in the unmodded game (and much more so in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym>) enemy mages sometimes place Spell Immunities into their Contingencies
      and Sequencers. This isn't really possible for the player because of the
      way the Spell Immunity spell works: casting it only gives you the menu
      to choose which Immunity you want to use.
      </p>
      <p>As of version 20, this component (using Ascension64's "ToBEx") handles everything automatically - you just have to choose the particular immunity you want when you cast the Contingency/Trigger/whatever.</p>
   <p><strong>Revert Greater Restoration back to only affecting one creature</strong></p>
  <p>Throne of Bhaal makes an undocumented (but widely known) modification to
    the Greater Restoration spell, making it into an area-effect spell that heals
    the entire party. This component reverts Greater Restoration to its <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> version,
    where only one creature can be affected.</p> 
  <p> Enemy priests assume Greater Restoration affects one target only (and so
    fairly rarely use it) even if you don't install this component.</p> 
  <p><strong>Blade Barrier and Globe of Blades only affect hostile creatures</strong></p> 
  <p>Even in the unmodded game, hostile priests used a special form of Blade
    Barrier that only affected their foes. (This is probably because, in the
    Infinity Engine, it is almost impossible to script creatures to avoid them
    crashing into each other.) This component (again in the name of fairness,
    and also of hassle avoidance) extends this to the player's version of these
    two spells: with it installed, players and <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    use the same form of Blade Barrier. (They don't quite use the old <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> version,
    which had a rather shorter range: they use a hybrid version, as large as
    the old <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> version but affecting
    only enemies).</p> 
  <p><strong>Cap damage done by Skull Trap at <acronym title="12 rolls of a six-sided die">12d6</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>Skull Trap, like the other <acronym title="Level 3">L3</acronym> spells
    Fireball and Lightning Bolt, does <acronym title="1 roll of a six-sided die">1d6</acronym> damage
    per level. Unlike those spells, though (and, I suspect, via an oversight
    on the developers' part, though I could be wrong) Skull Trap's damage is
    not capped at <acronym title="10 rolls of a six-sided die">10d6</acronym>,
    which makes it extremely lethal for a third level spell by the later part
    of the game. This component caps the damage of Skull Trap at <acronym title="12 rolls of a six-sided die">12d6</acronym> (the
    slightly higher cap reflects the much shorter range of Skull Trap compared
    to Fireball.</p> 
  <p>I don't know whether this component makes the game net easier or harder.
    I was led to write it after seeing a lich in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> playtesting cast a 3xSkull Trap Spell Sequencer, doing about
    100 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage even to characters who
    made all their saving throws.</p> 
  <p><strong>Make Power Word: Blind a single-target spell</strong></p>
  Unlike other Power Words, Power Word: Blind has a small area of effect. This
  both makes it rather powerful, and makes it virtually impossible for enemy <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> to
  use without "friendly-fire" incidents. This component just makes Power Word:
  Blind target a single creature. (This is another component which the mage <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> will assume is installed.)
  <p><strong>Make Minute Meteors into +2 weapons</strong></p>
  <p> In the unmodded game, the meteors created by the third-level Melf's Minute
    Meteors spell strike as +6 weapons, enough to penetrate any creature's resistances
    and to cut through even the Absolute Immunity spell. This strikes me as a
    bit overpowered for a third-level spell. This component makes meteors +2
    - still enough to hit most creatures, but not enough to cut through any of
    the protection-from-magic-weapon spells.</p> 
  <p><strong>Reduce the power of Inquisitors' Dispel Magic</strong></p> 
  <p> Inquisitors have a very fast powerful Dispel Magic ability, which is cast
    at twice their level. In most bits of the game, this is usually much higher
    than the majority of spellcasting enemies. This component reduces the power
    of the Dispel a little; you can choose to use it at 1.5xlevel or at 1xlevel.</p> 
<p><strong>Slightly reduce the power of Insect Plague spells (and the like) and let Fire Shields block them</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodified game, Insect Plague and Creeping Doom are very hard indeed for a spellcaster to deal with or defend against. This component
(which was partly inspired by Demivrgvs's Spell Revisions) grants a per-round saving throw against the spell-failure effects of the insects; it also
cause the insects to be destroyed if the target protects himself/herself with a Fire Shield spell (either colour) or Aura of Flaming Death spell.
<p><strong>Cosmetic change: stop Stoneskins from changing the caster's colour</strong></p>
The Stoneskin spell causes the recipient to turn a uniform grey colour, which is realistic but does get a bit monotonous when your spellcasters are permanently
protected by it. Note that this effects NPC mages too. This tweak (which uses Ascension64's "ToB Extender") removes the colour change from the spell.
<p><strong>Slightly increase the power of Mantle, Improved Mantle, and Absolute Immunity</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodded game, Mantle protects you from +2 or weaker weapons, Improved Mantle from +3 or weaker weapons, and Absolute Immunity from +5 or weaker weapons. 
In all cases, arguably this is slightly too weak given the prevalence of such weapons in the game. This component increases each protective range by one: Mantle
protects against +3 or weaker weapons, Improved Mantle against +4 or weaker weapons, and Absolute Immunity against +6 or weaker weapons (i.e., basically everything.)
<p>The mage AI, in choosing its defensive spells, assumes that this component is installed; if you don't install it, mages may be slightly too willing to use Mantle etc
instead of Protection from Magic Weapons, though this shouldn't be too noticeable.</p>
<p><strong>Make spell sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages</strong></p>
<p>In the unmodded game, spell sequencers, contingencies etc are in the Evocation school, making them unavailable to Enchanters; this is a serious weakness for the class. This component moves them
to be in both the Conjuration and Evocation schools (like Wish), so that all mages may use them. The affected spells are Minor Sequencer, Spell Sequencer, Spell Trigger, Contingency, and Chain Contingency.</p>
<p>Note that if you have Smarter Mages installed, SCS enchanters will use sequencers and the like even if you do not have this component installed.</p>
<p><strong>Add extra spell scrolls for hard-to-find spells</strong></p>
<p>This component adds one extra copy of a few spells into shops in Amn and Trademeet. The spells are chosen to be ones which otherwise tend only to be found late in the game or only given good luck with random loot.
The affected spells are Bigby's Clenched Fist, Bigby's Crushing Hand, Control Undead, Improved Mantle, Invisibility 10' Radius, Mordenkainen's Sword, Pierce Shield, Remove Magic, 
Ruby Ray of Reversal, Spell Shield, Stone to Flesh, and Summon Nishruu. The location of the scrolls is determined randomly at install time.</p>
<p><strong>Give True Sight the ability to prevent magical blindness</strong></p>
<p>This spell modifies True Sight (and the clerical version, True Seeing) so that the caster is immune to Blindness while the spell is effective; existing Blindness effects
are also removed.</p>
<p>(The main reason for this change is that Blindness is essentially lethal for enemies (especially spellcasters). With this
change, Truesight effectively works like Vocalize, in addition to its other effects.)</p>
<p><strong>Prevent clones made by the Simulacrum and Project Image spells from using their magic items.</strong></p>
<p>At present, clones can use magic items belonging to their creator - even one-shot items - which arguably isn't what the spell is intended to do. This component blocks use of useable items, by greying out the quick-item bar for clones. Magic weapons, armour, and protective devices still function normally.</p>


  <h3>Item Tweaks</h3>
  <p> These components remove, move or tone down the powers of a small number
    of magic items. It's not at all systematic (there are mods out there which
    go through almost all the items in the game and reduce their powers) but
    it reduces the extent to which a party can coast by on a few &uuml;ber-items.</p> 
  <p><strong>Remove the Shield of Balduran from the game</strong></p>
  <p> I looked fairly extensively for ways of scripting beholders to deal with
    the Shield of Balduran without resorting to cheese, or for ways of toning
    down its powers while keeping it recognisable, but I couldn't find one. Ultimately,
    the character equipped with the Shield of Balduran is invulnerable to beholders,
    pretty much irrespective of what strategy they use. This component (which,
    as always, is optional) removes the shield entirely from the game, leaving
    beholders as a challenge again.</p> 
  <p><strong>Remove the invisibility power of the Staff of the Magi</strong></p>
  <p>The Staff of the Magi allows the wielder to go invisible, at will and without
    losing any time to do so, and this is famously overpowered. This component
    just removes the invisibility power from the Staff.</p> 
  <p><strong>Move Vhailor's Helm into Throne of Bhaal</strong></p> 
  <p>Vhailor's Helm is not absurdly powerful relative to some of the items that
    can be found later in the game, but it's a bit much for something that can
    be bought for cash at the start of chapter 2. This component moves it into
    the early part of the Throne of Bhaal expansion (see the spoilers for details).</p>
  <p><strong>Move the Cloak of Mirroring into Throne of Bhaal</strong></p>
  <p> You can't get the Cloak until later in the game; still, it's hugely powerful and could be argued to be unbalancing at the time it's introduced. This component moves it into Throne of Bhaal (see the spoilers
    for details).</p> 
  <p><strong>Move the Robe of Vecna into Throne of Bhaal</strong></p>
  <p> Similarly, the Robe of Vecna - one of the most powerful items in the game
    for a spellcaster - is overpowered for something that can be bought in chapter
    2, and so this component moves it into Throne of Bhaal (see the spoilers
    for details).</p>
  <p><strong>Replace +1 magical weapons with Fine ones</strong></p>
  <p>This is a flavour tweak rather than a balance-driven one: as with the equivalent
    component in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym>,
    it replaces almost all +1 weapons in the game with non-magical versions,
    which still have +1 to hit and damage but don't have an initiative bonus
    and don't count as magical. The rationale for this is that the number of
    magic items lying around the Sword Coast is completely absurd. My alpha version
    of this component changed +2 weapons too, but that turns out to have unwanted
    effects on game balance - +2 nonmagical weapons are great to use against
    mages with the Protection from Magic Weapons spell running, and the protagonist
    is probably immune to nonmagical weapons in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> and
    needs to be affectable by at least some of his opponents.</p> 
    <p><strong>Remove Arrows of Dispelling from stores</strong></p>
  <p>This component (which was previously part of "Improved Minor Encounters") removes all the Arrows of Dispelling from stores; you might
  want to install this if you find Arrows of Dispelling a bit too effective.
    <p><strong>Make the Healing and Resurrection powers of the Rod of Resurrection into separate powers</strong></p>
  <p> Having a magic item which not only restores its target to life but also heals them fully is extremely powerful. This component mildly tones down this
  power, by giving the rod separate resurrection and healing powers. It can still restore its target to life, but they have only one hit point; it can also cast
  a Heal spell on living targets.
    <p><strong>Change Carsomyr so that its dispel-on-contact power gains a saving throw</strong></p>
  <p>Carsomyr (the holy paladin sword) dispels all magical protections instantly on hitting its target, which drastically changes the flavour of many battles (notably
  those with mages and priests, and to a lesser extent with dragons). This component (which was borrowed directly from Demivrgvs' and Mike1072's Item Revisions) grants
  a saving throw against this effect, which makes it useful but less transformative.
  <h3>Gameplay Tweaks</h3> 
  <p> These components could equally well be called "miscellaneous tweaks". </p>
  <!--  <p><strong>Randomly change the locations of many in-game items</strong></p>
  <p>This component moves approximately 150 of the game's magical items to new locations, hopefully in a way
  which doesn't disrupt realism or balance. <b>You must start a new game to use it:</b> installing in the middle of your
  game will break it. (<b>Re</b>installing in mid game won't, though.) If you install this component and play two successive games, the items will
  be in the same place in those successive games; you need to reinstall it to rerandomise them.)
  <p>(Note to the cognoscenti: there are basically two ways to write a random-item mod. One (used by Improved Anvil and by one version of Wisp's Item Randomizer mod)
  changes the locations of items via in-game scripts, initialised by a script in the start area. The other (used by Weimer's Icewind Dale 2 ease-of-use mod and by the
  other version of Wisp's Item Randomizer mod) instead rearranges the game files when you install the mod. My randomiser does the latter. I don't pretend any particular
  advantage of mine over Wisp's; on the contrary, Wisp's is certainly better tested and probably better thought through. I probably wouldn't have written this one if I'd
  known of Wisp's project, but having written it, I thought I might as well include it.)-->
  <p><strong>Remove unrealistically helpful items from certain areas.</strong></p>
  <p>Vampires do not stockpile stakes in their lairs; magic golems are not usually
    found near stashes of nonmagical weapons; demons' lairs are not usually stocked
    with books explaining how to eliminate their defences and wands stocked with
    the requisite spells; trolls are not generally found in places filled with
    fire and acid arrows; cities under siege do not generally have large quantities
    of +3 weapons for sale in bars. But in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> all
    these things occur. Presumably this is intended to reduce frustration, but
    I just find it spoils my suspension of disbelief. This component tries to
    remove all such implausibly-placed items. (Obviously, things like stakes
    and fire arrows are still plentifully available, but you can't count on just
    finding them lying around where you want them.) </p> 
  <p><strong>Remove unrealistically convenient ammunition from the game</strong></p> 
  Similarly, the game has vast stashes of ammunition lying around for the taking,
  presumably because the developers thought you'd be bored of having to buy it.
  This component removes all the ammunition from containers, for those
  who find things just a bit too convenient to be realistic.
<p>As of version 8, this component can be fine-tuned. You can choose to remove only the non-magical ammunition, to remove all the ammunition except those nice +3/+4 items you find in Throne of Bhaal, or just to remove everything.</p>
  <p><strong>Faster bears</strong></p> 
  <p>"If you're in the woods, and you run into an angry bear, don't worry about
    it. Bears can't move very fast, you can outdistance it at a brisk walk".</p> 
  <p>It's unrealistic that <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> bears
    can't catch up with the party. This component tweaks their movement rate
    until it's about the same as for humans. This also makes the druid's bear
    shapeshift less annoying. </p> 
    <p><strong>Grant large, flying, non-solid or similar creatures immunity to Web and Entangle</strong></p>
  <p>
  Logically, things like Fire Elementals, Grey Oozes, and Giants ought to be unaffected by Web and Entangle effects. This component grants them immunity to those effects. Affected creatures are Elementals (all except small Earth), djinnis, efreetis, anything larger and stronger than an ogre (which basically means umber hulks, shambling mounds, large demons, giants, otyughs, and wyverns), magical flying swords, and oozes and slimes.</p>
  <p><strong>Allow the Cowled Wizards to detect spellcasting in most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla</strong></p>
  <p>The Cowled Wizards claim to ban magic everywhere in Athkatla; in practice, though, they only complain if you cast spells out of doors.
  This component extends their watch to most indoor, above-ground areas in Athkatla (there are a few exceptions, mostly places where wizards live (e.g. Prebek's tower) 
  or where it's likely that the owners have made arrangements with the Cowled Wizards (e.g. the Copper Coronet).</p>
  <p><strong>Increase the price of a licence to practice magic in Athkatla.</strong></p>
  <p>The default price for a magic licence from the Cowled Wizards is 5,000gp. This component allows you to increase it to an amount between 10,000gp and 50,000gp, depending
  on which option you choose during installation.</p>
  <p><strong>Increase the price asked by Gaelan Baele.</strong></p>
  <p>This component aims both to make it more realistic for the player to linger
    in chapter 2 of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> (which in gameplay
    terms is often rather tempting, but is hard to justify on roleplaying grounds)
    and to add an extra challenge by restricting the player's wealth in the first
    part of the game. As everyone knows, in the unmodded game Gaelan asks the
    player to provide 20,000gp. With this component installed, he will want more
    - between 40,000gp and 120,000gp, depending on which option you choose during
    installation. </p> 
<p><strong>Make Freedom scrolls available earlier.</strong></p>
Scrolls of Freedom (the spell that reverses Imprisonment) are fairly thin on the ground early in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>, whereas Liches love Imprisoning people. This component makes a few scrolls of Freedom available from Athkatlan stores (the Coppor Coronet and the Adventurer's Mart, in fact.)
  <p><strong>Make Watchers' Keep accessible between <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym></strong></p> 
  <p>In roleplaying terms, the natural time to explore Watchers' Keep is between
    the end of Shadows of Amn and the start of Throne of Bhaal. Before chapter
    4 you're probably too weak; in chapters 6 and 7 of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> you're
    in a desperate race against time; in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>,
    the way the start works makes it difficult not to take random time off from
    urgent business to explore Watchers' Keep. </p> 
  <p> This component moves the start location of Throne of Bhaal to Watchers'
    Keep, so that you're moved there immediately after the end of <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym>.
    You can then explore <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> to your
    heart's content. When you want to start <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>,
    just leave <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> via the world map.
    You can still return to <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> after
    leaving. </p>
  <p> Be warned: you don't have any stable base, or any way to change your party,
    as long as you're starting at <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym>.
    If you find you need either, you'll need to do the first part of <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    Similarly, although you could start a new game of <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> using
    this component, this is only a good idea if you're masochistic enough to
    want to solo Watchers' Keep with a starting-level <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> character! </p> 
  <p> This component is only available on Windows versions of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym>.</p>
      <p><b>Warning:</b> As of version 12, if you install this component you will <b>not</b> be able to access Watcher's Keep during the Shadows of Amn part of the game. This is to prevent a persistent
      bug, which I've been unable to track down, whereby going to WK during SoA triggers the chapter counter to advance to chapter 8.</p>
  <p><strong>Recover lost items from Hell</strong></p>
  <p> Because you're transported directly from Hell at the end of chapter 7,
    any items on the ground (notably, those dropped by slaughtered companions)
      are lost in the lower planes. This component (suggested by the bigg) fixes
      this problem: your items will be on the ground waiting for you when you
      start chapter 8. The component is compatible with the &quot;Make Watchers
      Keep accessible between <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>&quot; component, and you can install
  them in either order.</p>
  <p><strong>Improved shapeshifting</strong></p>
<p>This component (inspired in part by Wesley Weimer's Shapeshifter Rebalancing component) modifies all of the druid innate shapeshift abilities (and the druid/cleric elemental-shapeshift HLA)
to be useable instantly (that is, without requiring a six-second cooldown before the next spell can be cast). It does so by creating "symbolic paws":
if you equip one, you instantly shapeshift. Other than that, the effects of the shapeshift are largely the same as previously, though some of the ability score
and attack bonuses have been tweaked slightly. Note that shapeshifting still blocks spellcasting. </p>
<p>If you have both this component and the "improved priests" component installed, enemy druids will use improved shapeshifting. </p>
  <p><strong>Make party members less likely to die irreversibly</strong></p>
  <p>This component tries to prevent "chunking", the annoying permanent death of your
    character when you're reduced below -10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym>.
    Characters who get reduced to 0 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> or
    below just die in the usual fashion and can be resurrected. It isn't possible
    to prevent quite all forms of chunking (massive damage from fire, in particular, still seems to cause chunking fairly reliably), but this component should make it
    a rarer occurrence. This may be useful in the later stages of the game,
    when melee opponents often do 30-40 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> damage
    per blow - that 10 <acronym title="Hit Points">hp</acronym> safety margin
    starts to feel slender. </p>
     <p><strong>Randomize the maze in Watcher's Keep</strong></p>
  <p>This component is for the benefit of people who've now basically got the Watcher's Keep teleport maze memorized. It randomly rearranges the maze to
  one of three different alternative configurations. Don't install or reinstall this component while you're exploring the maze (before you enter it, or after you've
  left it, will be fine).</p>

      <p><strong>Customise access to strongholds</strong></p>
  <p>This component is actually eight separate components, one for each stronghold available to players (the Radiant Heart, Nalia's Keep, the Planar Sphere, etc.)
  It lets you choose, stronghold by stronghold, to make the stronghold available to all classes (it also drops the rule that says you can only have one stronghold). 
  <p>The idea of this is that it's a rather more fine-tuned version of the long-established Tweakpack component that lets you get access to all strongholds. It might be
  useful if, say, you think your Paladin ought to be offered the Cleric and Fighter strongholds, but isn't likely to be offered the Mage or Thief ones.</p>
  <p><strong>Delay the arrival of the "bonus merchants" in the Adventurers' Mart and the Copper Coronet</strong></p>
  <p>This component causes the "bonus merchants" (Deidre and Joluv) to appear a little later in the game (by default they are in the Adventurers' Mart and the Copper
  Coronet, respectively, as soon as you go there). One of them (chosen at random) will appear once you've started Chapter Six; the other will appear once you've either completed
  four of the "stronghold quests" or recovered the Rhyn Lanthorn.</p>
  <p>You don't need to have the bonus merchants already installed (e.g. through Tweak Pack) to run this component; if you do, it won't matter.</p>
  <p><strong>Reduce the rate of reputation gain</strong></p>
  <p>In general, if you're playing a half-way honorable character in BG2, your reputation fairly rapidly reaches 20 and stays there. The idea of this component 
  is to slow down the rate at which you gain reputation: you can choose the degree of slowdown.</p>
  <p>In more detail: any time you would have gained 2 or more reputation points, you gain one fewer point than you should have. Any time you would have gained one,
  it's decided at random whether you actually do gain it, according to the probability you choose at install time.</p>
  <p><strong>Treat mages' and priests' High-Level Abilities as innate abilities rather than memorisable spells</strong></p>
  <p>This component causes the 10th level spells that mages get as High-Level Abilities, and the Quest spells that priests get likewise, 
  to become disentangled from existing 9th level mage spells and 7th level priest spells. If installed, 10th level and Quest spells
  are no longer added to the character's list of spells to learn. Instead, each can be cast once per day in addition to the
  character's normal spells. Each spell can only be taken once. Note that clones (Projected Images and Simulacra) of the spellcaster do not get High-level abilities.</p>
  <p>The component should be compatible with other mods (notably Refinements) which change the High-Level Ability system.
  If it is installed, SCS mages and priests will also receive High-Level Abilities in this way.</p>
  <p>I'm grateful to TheBigg and Vilcakis, from whose rather similar mod I took significant inspiration, and to Ardanis for
  the suggestion that each ability should only be available once, which changed me from a strong opponent of this change to
  a (cautious) supporter.</p>
 <h3>Cosmetic and ease-of-use tweaks</h3>
  <p><strong>Ease-of-use party <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p>
  <p>This <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> script, suitable
    for all characters, is not intended to help you fight difficult battles,
    but it might make your life simpler (especially where pre-casting spells
    is concerned - <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> virtually requires you to do a lot of precombat spellcasting
    of long-duration spells, but it's tedious to do manually.) The <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> has
    5 functions: </p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>The character will fight, prioritising opponents who are not immobile
      and helpless, not fighting if they're trying to Turn Undead, and not wasting
      Melf's Minute Meteors, Energy Blades or Invisibility (the idea of this <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is
      to help you mop up weak opponents, so it conserves resources). You can
      shift the character between melee (D) and ranged weapons (F) using the
      hotkeys. <br /> 
      If you'd rather that your character did not enter melee, you can toggle
      melee off by pressing (K). Characters with melee toggled off will fight
      if enemies are in weapon range but won't be proactive about getting into
      range. </li> 
    <li>The character will cast some long-duration spells when out of combat.
      There are 4 settings for this, which you can toggle through using (S).
      On setting 1, the character uses no spells. On setting 2 and up, the character
      will cast all of the following spells if they are memorized (and not already
      active): Stoneskin, Iron Skins, Armor, Melf's Minute Meteors, Goodberry. </li> 
    <li>On setting 2 and up, the character will consume Goodberries if injured
      and out of combat. On setting 3 and up, the character will also consume
      potions of healing. On setting 4, the character will consume potions of
      extra-healing. </li> 
    <li>On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically activate the following
      items once per day: the Cloak of the Stars; the Gargoyle Boots; the Belt
      of Fortitude. </li> 
      <li> On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically cast low-level healing spells on the 
      party if they have them. The casting is highly accelerated and cannot be done in combat; 
      characters will only cast healing spells of a level 2 or more below the highest level of spells
      which they can cast.</li>
    <li>The character will cast some spells, by hotkey, on the whole party. This
      casting is highly accelerated, cannot be done in combat, and only casts
      on characters who are not already protected. Its main function is for later
      in the game when you can afford to carry enough spells to protect the whole
      party. The hot-keys are: C for Chaotic Commands; V for Death Ward; B for
      Protection from Fire, Protection from Lightning, and Protection from Magic
      Energy; Z for the paladin's Protection from Evil. (The latter key is already
      allocated to a hotkey (sleep) - sorry, I was running out of hotkeys. To
      use it you'll need to disable Z in the Configuration program. Later versions
      of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> will
      feature a more flexible hotkey-allocation system.) </li> 
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Remove animation from the Cloak of Mirroring (leave it for other
      spells and effects that use the same graphic)</strong></p> 
  <p>The Cloak of Mirroring creates an annoying spherical animation that is a
    pain to have around permanently. The <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak
    Pack eliminates that animation entirely from the game, but that can be a
    nuisance for <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> as the animation, annoying or not, is a good way of telling
    which mages have which defensive spells running. This component just removes
    the animation from the Cloak, leaving it in place for other spells and items. </p> 
  <p><strong>Move Boo into Minsc's pack</strong></p> 
  <p>Identical to the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> component
    of the same name, this component shifts Boo from his normal quick-slot space
    into a free slot in Minsc's inventory. It must be installed before the start
    of the game. </p>
      <p><strong>Remove blur effect from the displacer cloak</strong></p>
  <p>Like it says really: this removes the annoying blurry graphic when someone
    wears the displacer cloak.</p>
  <h3><acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> enhancements</h3>
<p>The distinction between this section and the next ("tactical challenges") is a bit arbitrary, but basically components in this section either don't alter creatures' abilities at all, or do so in a relatively low-key way.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter general <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the generic <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> used
    in melee and ranged combat throughout <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>.
    It will mostly affect fighters, thieves, and monsters without large numbers
    of special abilities. </p> 
  <p> Main features of this component include: </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Enemies will try to choose targets more intelligently. This will be most
      noticeable for ranged attackers - the game's engine makes it difficult
      to safely tell melee fighters to do much more than "attack nearest". </li> 
    <li>Melee attackers will fairly quickly notice that their opponent is immune
      to their attacks (if you're protected from magic weapons, for instance)
      and will try someone else; ranged attackers will similarly notice spells
      like Physical Mirror. </li> 
    <li>Thieves will use their backstab and hide-in-shadows power as much as
      they can, and will avoid wasting backstabs on characters with Stoneskin
      or Mirror Image. </li> 
    <li>Enemies will use potions if they have them (though this component doesn't
      give them any). </li>
    <li>Enemies with class abilities (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Kai)
      or high-level abilities (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Whirlwind
      Attack) will use them. This script also grants <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s
      to any fighter-type character of level 20 or above (there are essentially
      none of these in Shadows of Amn). </li> 
    <li>As with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym>,
      enemies above a certain minimum intelligence will usually prioritise opponents
      who are not stunned, held or otherwise helpless. From their point of view,
      they're fighting to win, and if they kill all non-helpless opponents they
      can finish off the helpless ones at their leisure. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Better calls for help</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the way in which intelligent enemies call for help
    from offscreen allies. The unmodded calls for help in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> are
    much better than the ones in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym>,
    so this component will have a less dramatic effect on play than the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> component
    of the same name, but it should still lead to a smoother experience. </p> 
  <p><strong>More sensible choices of weapon proficiencies and kits for fighters</strong></p>
  <p>This component ensures that the fighters in the game make intelligent use of their available weapon proficiency choices, by taking weapon and style specialisations as appropriate. It also allocates
  kits to a (fairly small) number of fighters, and corrects some inaccurate saving throws etc.</p>

  <p><strong>Potions for <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s</strong></p>
  <p>Potions are one of the most effective and cheap ways for a humanoid creature
    to enhance its combat ability. The party collect literally hundreds of them
    through <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> and can easily buy
    hundreds more; it's not that realistic that enemy <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    don't have them. This component gives healing and protection potions of various
    sorts to humanoid <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s; it
    also gives combat-boosting potions to fighters and invisibility potions to
    thieves. The potion allocation is based on level (the higher level your opponent,
    the more likely he is to have good potions); it also requires a higher level
    for a Throne of Bhaal <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> to
    have potions than for a Shadows of Amn one, since Throne of Bhaal is crawling
    with mid-level grunts. (Similarly, even the <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> component
    gives potions out less readily than the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> version
    of this component.) </p> 
  <p> This component "plays fair", in the sense that potions are given to <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    when they are created, not beamed into existence just in time to be drunk.
    This means you'll probably end up with (even) more potions if you use this
    component, since you'll be able to steal a few from enemies who are killed
    before being able to use them. </p> 
  <p>As of v5, it's optional whether potions carried by your enemies are droppable.
    (As Alesia_BH pointed out to me on the Bioware boards, it's not exactly unrealistic
    that glass bottles get smashed in the heat of battle!) As of v10, you can choose any of six different rules for what fraction of potions are recoverable. </p>
  <p>The Superior Healing potion only gets given to enemies in Throne of Bhaal
    (to preserve a flavour difference between the two components). </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Spiders</strong></p>
  <p>This component is basically identical to the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym> version:
    it gives some spiders the ability to cast webs and tightens up the scripting
    for phase spiders. Realistically it won't have much effect on your game except
    at a fairly early stage. </p>
  <p><strong>Improved Golems</strong></p>
  <p>This component doesn't really make golems smarter (they're supposed to be stupid) But it streamlines their scripts a bit, gives their weapons a 
  sensible range, makes them immune to Lower Resistance and to poison, and <b>tries</b> to prevent situations where golems get stuck behind
  barricades It also fixes an animation glitch in the Iron Golem animation - this hopefully makes iron golems a bit prettier when they attack and blow clouds. </p>
<p><strong>Increased Staying Power for Fiends</strong></p>
<p>This isn't really a separate component at all, more of an option for the "Improved Fiends" component. All it does is increase the hit points of the Baatezu and Tanar'ri by around 60 percent. This shouldn't make a drastic difference, but it will lead to fiends remaining around in battle for a bit longer.
  <p><strong>Improved Fiends</strong></p>
  <p>This component overhauls the "Fiends" (i.e., Baatezu and Tanar'ri, aka Devils
    and Demons) throughout <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    More than any other component of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>, this component not only upgrades their scripting but actually
    gives them a variety of new magical abilities. I've based the abilities the
    fiends received on a combination of 2nd and 3rd edition pen-and-paper <acronym title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D</acronym>;
    details can be found in the Spoilers section. However, the fiends' basic
    combat abilities and defences remain essentially unchanged: other than a
    certain amount of systemisation (where two similar-looking fiends have wildly
    different immunities, for instance) I've left their hit rolls, damage, immunities,
    magic resistance etc pretty much alone. In fact, in one or two cases I've removed a power
    (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> permanent haste) that seemed
    to be added as a cheesy way of making a fight harder. </p>
<p>As of version 7, this component includes Demogorgon and the Chromatic Demon. Again, they mostly get changes to their spells and strategies, though
the Chromatic Demon is now 100% immune to physical damage, not just 95% immune.</p>
  <p> This component, and the next three, all offer a choice as to how creatures'
    magic works. If you visualise fiendly magic as being an innate power, cast
    at will and instantly, you can choose for fiends to have "fast, uninterruptable
    magic". Fiends will still cast spells only once per round, but do so instantly
    and cannot be interrupted. If you prefer fiends to cast spells in the normal
    way, that option is also available. (Fiendly <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is
    optimised for option 1, though; if you choose option 2, fiends may occasionally
    make slightly suboptimal magic-vs-melee choices.) </p>
  <p> This component also makes a substantial change to the way fiend-summoning
    magic works (this is one of the few places where <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> breaks the rule that players and <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s
    should be treated equally). I assume that enemy spellcasters (who, after
    all, have been learning high-level magic far longer than the party) summon
    demons with whom they have a pre-existing pact. These demons won't attack
    their summoner - and, crucially, will attack the party even if they are protected
    by Protection from Evil. The practical upshot is that the only demons in
    the game now kept at bay by a Pro/Evil are the ones that your party summons.
    This makes summoned demons rather more useful, and you'll see more of them
    being summoned. <strong>Note: this component will only have an effect on
    the game if you also install <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>'s "Smarter Mages" and/or "Smarter Priests" components; unmodded
    priests and mages continue to use the original version</strong>. </p> 
  <p><strong>Smarter Genies</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the various genies (djinni, efreet, and the like)
    in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>. Mostly this is done by
    improving their scripts and systematising the rather chaotic list of spells
    and abilities that different genies get (in the original game, if you charmed
    a genie you'd see that it had a totally different list of spells from the
    ones it was actually using!) However, the component also changes summoned
    genies so that they count as "Gated" rather than "Summoned"; the practical
    consequence of this is that they are immune to Death Spell. This makes genie-summoning
    rather more useful. </p> 
  <p> As with the "Smarter Fiends", component, this component has an option to
    let genies cast their spells instantly and uninterruptably. </p> 
<p><strong>Increased Staying Power for Celestials</strong></p>
<p>This isn't really a separate component at all, more of an option for the "Smarter Celestials" component. Rather like the equivalent component for fiends, it just increases the hit points of celestials by about fifty percent, giving them the ability to hang around in combat for a bit longer. 
  <p><strong>Smarter Celestials</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the way in which summoned devas and planetars use
    their magical and combat powers. It only affects celestials summoned by enemy <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s,
    and it doesn't grant any extra abilities - it just uses the existing abilities
    more effectively. </p> 
  <p> As with the "Smarter Fiends", component, this component has an option to
    let celestials cast their spells instantly and uninterruptably. This component
    will also affect <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>-summoned
    celestials; it will not, however, affect the celestials in the "<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> celestials" mod. </p> 
<p><strong>Increased Staying Power for Dragons</strong></p>
<p>This isn't really a separate component at all, more of an option for the "Smarter Dragons" component. All it does is triple the hit points of all the dragons 
in the game. At the moment dragons have about 200 hp, which by the late stages of Shadows of Amn really isn't enough to go toe-to-toe with an entire party.
Somehow, it doesn't seem right that dragons have to rely on Stoneskin and Protection from Magic Weapons - this component gives them the ability to hang around in battle for longer.
<p><strong>Standardise Dragon Immunities</strong></p>
<p>Again, this isn't really a separate component at all, more of an option for the "Smarter Dragons" component. It tries to be a bit more systematic about the powers that dragons are and aren't immune to (it varies wildly through the game, especially
between Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. In particular, basically all ToB dragons have immunity to Imprisonment, death magic, and "vorpal" attacks (i.e. decapitation). This component extends that immunity to 
SoA dragons.</p>
  <p><strong>Smarter Dragons</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the intelligence of all the dragons in the game (including Adalon and Fll'Yissetat as of version 10, but
   Abazigal is only modified if you also install the "SCS AI for Ascension" component).
 It <strong>tries</strong> to do this without granting
    them new abilities (the main grey area is exactly how many spells dragons
    should have: the unmodded game is somewhat inconsistent about it). At any
    rate, in play you should - hopefully - see dragons being a bit more discerning
    with their targeting and their spell priorities. (So: this component is trying
    to pretty much exactly what the Tactics smarter dragons component tries to
    do. Obviously I prefer my one, but it's a matter of taste!) </p> 
  <p> The component also modifies dragon breath to penetrate magic resistance
    (the unmodded game is a bit inconsistent on this point, but since the <em>spell</em> Dragon's
    Breath goes through <acronym title="Magic Resistance">MR</acronym>, presumably
    real dragon breath should too!) and lets dragons cast spells at a more realistic
    level (usually 15-25 or so). </p> 
  <p> As with the "Smarter Fiends", component, this component has an option to
    let dragons cast their spells instantly and uninterruptably. </p> 
    <p><strong>Enemy spellcasters use Simulacrum and Project Image spells</strong></p>
  <p>This isn't really a separate component at all, more an option for the "Smarter
    mages" and "Smarter beholders" components. If it and they are both installed, mages and/or Elder Orbs will
    sometimes use the "clone" (Simulacrum and Project Image) spells against you.
    This component is optional partly because some people regard clones as cheesy,
    but mostly because I'm worried it might be a source of serious slowdown on
    low-end machines. </p> 
   <p><strong>Smarter Beholders</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of
    the beholders, gauths, elder orbs and hive mothers in <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> and <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>.
    (It basically tries to do it non-cheesily, but it's hard to define this exactly
    since beholder powers are almost all scripted). Beholders get to use their
    eyestalks once per round each, but they will tend to manage to get through
    more of them in a round; their targeting has also been drastically improved
    (the new scripts are about 150 times the length of the old ones!) </p> 
  <p> In accordance with <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> 2nd edition
    rules, beholders are now immune to most (not all) of their own eyestalks,
    which makes them more willing to bombard their way through Spell Deflection.
    I have removed the Disintegrate eyestalk power (I don't like scripting for
    powers that require you to reload on a failed save) but I have added a Telekinesis
    eyestalk (more for fun than for increased challenge). And I have borrowed,
    with thanks, the Quest Pack component which allows beholders to lose their
    eyestalks when damaged. Beholders are also unable to use eyestalk powers
    when blinded (although their allies may use anti-magic rays to remove the
    blindness). </p> 
  <p>As of version 2, players of a masochistic disposition can turn the disintegration
    power back on at the console. Just enter CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(&quot;DMWWBeholderDisintegrate&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,1).</p> 
  <p> Hive mothers use the same range of powers as in the original game, but
    use them more efficiently, and use their eyestalks in the gap while they're
    waiting to cast spells again. Elder orbs were tricky because of the rather
    inconsistent range of powers they show in the unmodded game, but I have interpreted
    them as casting spells just as standard mages do, and as knowing 2 spells
    of each level. Their choice of spell, and of Contingency, Spell Trigger et
    al, has been optimised more, and they too use eyestalk powers while waiting
    to cast again (and show a preference for short-casting-time spells, so as
    to allow more eyestalk use.) </p> 
  <p> It might be worth noting that, even in the unmodded game, hive mothers
    can see through invisibility (though elder orbs cannot). </p>
<p>(New as of version 6). Beholder eyestalk rays ought to be able to work their way through Spell Turning spells and the like: a few beholder rays ought to be enough to overwhelm a Spell Turning spell (and for that reason, beholders are scripted to use their rays even on protected characters). However, for whatever reason this doesn't seem to work very well in-game. So instead, beholder rays now have a random chance (thirty percent) of dispelling a spell protection on contact; this should work out, on average, to the same thing. This is optional: you can choose whether or not to let beholder rays "burn through" defences in this way.
<p>Also as of version 6, beholders have an additional trick to use against certain characters; see the spoilers for details.</p>
<p>As of version 16, you can choose at install time to have beholders use an alternative form of their antimagic ray. 
In pen-and-paper D&D, a beholder's eyestalk blocks all magical effects, beneficial or otherwise, on the target for as long as it's
targetted. In BG2, the eye is more powerful: it removes all magical effects, blocks spellcasting for several rounds, but doesn't 
block enemy magic attacks (including the beholder's other eyestalks). Optionally, the beholder antimagic ray blocks <b>all</b> magical
effects, including harmful ones, for one round, and also disables magical activity (spellcasting etc) by the target for one round; this is
supposed to simulate the beholder bathing the target with its antimagic ray for one round. This subcomponent obviously requires different
scripting, so beholders will use their antimagic ray a bit more cautiously if it's installed.
<p>Also as of version 16, if Spell Revisions is installed then Beholders will use a Spell-Revisions-style disintegrate ray (at 10th level for 
ordinary beholders, 20th level for Hive Mothers). The default in this case is that they <b>do</b> use Disintegrate; entering
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(&quot;DMWWBeholderDisintegrateSR&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,1) will disable it.

  <p><strong>Smarter mind flayers</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the intelligence of the mind-flayers and their kin
    (specifically, it upgrades flayers, ulitharids, vampiric illithids, and the
    Master Brain). It allows the illithids to use a somewhat wider range of abilities
    than before (notably, they have access to a few physical psionic attacks,
    like Ballistic Attack, and they can astrally travel to more convenient bits
    of the battlefield); it significantly improves their targetting; it allows
    them to use each power every 2-4 rounds and choose the most appropriate available
    power; it lets them avoid attacking targets who are immune to their abilities
    or to their physical attacks.</p> 
  <p>There are a variety of options in this component. You can choose whether
    to let mind flayers see invisible opponents (I'm inclined to think that their
    great intelligence and wide range of psionic powers means that invisibility
    is no barrier to them; not everyone agrees, though). You can also choose
    to give mind flayers 50% resistance to melee and missile damage. (The Tactics
    version of smarter mind flayers grants both these powers; both are optional
    in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym>.)</p> 
  <p> The component also makes a few changes in how psionic powers work. It mildly
    increases the damage done by physical psionic attacks (though not to anything
    like the extent that Tactics does) and it changes "anti-psionic" items so
    that they do not protect from physical psionic attacks. (On my interpretation, "Ballistic
    attack" involves using psionics on a rock, not on a <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>).
    This gives illithids a few more options when facing enemies who are shielded
    from mental attack. The component also systematises illithid magic resistance
    and level, so that all of them are 90% magic resistant (previously there
    were a few exceptions) and the same level. As of version 16, it allows illithids' detonation power to destroy skeletons automatically (in accordance with the 2nd edition rules, as it happens). (This can be disabled at the console.)</p>
  <p> If the "Smarter Mages" component and this one are both installed, the Alhoon
    is also upgraded. I interpret him as a <acronym title="Level 18">L18</acronym> mage
    with the psionic powers of an ulitharid, I also give him the "split mind" psionic
    power, which allows him to cast a spell and use a psionic power in the same
    round. (Yes, purists, this is a valid 2nd edition psionic power!) This guy
    is now fairly dangerous. </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Vampires</strong></p> 
  This component - which has been completely overhauled as of version 16 - upgrades vampires' intelligence and abilities, roughly in line
  with pen-and-paper Dungeons and Dragons. They should target their magic more effectively, pick on people
  vulnerable to their level drain, and so forth. The component also standardises
  vampire statistics a bit (usually increasing vampire ability scores slightly). It allows vampires to summon wolves, bats, or rats (the bat summoning was
  present in earlier versions but has been toned down), to drink blood (which drains Constitution) as well as draining levels, and to make much more use
  of their various shapeshifting abilities (bat, rat, wolf, gas cloud).</p>
  <p>
<p>This component does affect Bodhi, but only if you don't install the "Improved Bodhi" component (in other words, if you want Bodhi to use her original-game abilities more effectively but don't want to give her the extra powers of that component, install Smarter Vampires but not Improved Bodhi).
  <p><strong>Smarter Githyanki</strong></p> 
  <p>This component improves the githyanki in the game, mostly through better
    scripting for their psionic powers (those which they demonstrate in-game
    in one way or another), although it does also slightly raise the level of
    some of the stronger gith. It also makes the same general upgrade to psionics
    that the "Smarter Mind Flayers" component does. Finally, it upgrades the
    githyanki lair in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> by the rather
    simple expedient of opening all the doors. ("Sir, just a suggestion, but
    maybe we should fall on our enemies all at once rather than dividing our
    forces into four bite-sized chunks?") </p>
 <p><strong>Add high-level abilities (<acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s)
      to <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> mages</strong></p>
  <p>This component (which has basically no effect unless you also install ("Smarter Mages") gives <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s
    (i.e. 10th level spells) to mages in Throne of Bhaal and Watchers' Keep (almost
    none get <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s in the unmodded
    game). This works the same way as the spell-swap component of "Smarter Mages":
    existing 9th level spells are swapped for <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s.
    The <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s used are Dragon's
    Breath, Summon Dark Planetar, Improved Alacrity, and Wish (which, I know,
    is technically not a <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>). </p> 
  <p> This component has two options. If you think that <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s
    are special powers available only to demigods and those who ally with them,
    then install the "only selected mages" component, and only special creatures
    in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> will get them (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym>,
    liches, the Five and their lieutenants - but not random enemy wizards). Probably
    a little under half of all <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> wizards
    of level 18+ benefit. If you think that <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s
    are just something everyone gets above a certain level (or if you just want
    a challenge) then choose the other option, in which case pretty much all
    level 18+ <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> wizards will get <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s. </p> 
  <p><strong>Add high-level abilities (<acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s)
      to <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> mages</strong></p> 
  <p>This components is self-explanatory. I include it mostly for completeness
    (personally, I prefer <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s
    to be restricted to <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>) but they're
    there if you want them. If you start getting planetars and Dragon Breaths dumped on you when you're fourteenth level, don't blame me. Note that a much smaller fraction of spellcasters
    get <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s than in <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> if
    you choose the "special characters only" options. </p>
    
  <p><strong>Smarter mages</strong></p>
  <p>This component drastically improves the intelligence of pretty much all
    the arcane spellcasters (liches, mages, fighter/mages, thief/mages, bards)
    in the game. It does so in three ways: </p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>Better choices of spells and sequencers. The spell lists of mages are
      systematically restructured to swap useless for useful spells. I've tended
      to err on the side of variety over usefulness: Maze is less useful than
      Horrid Wilting but it's still fairly useful, so I've kept it; but Meteor
      Swarm just can't compete with other 9th level spells, so it goes. Enemy
      sequencers, spell triggers, contingencies and the like are all completely
      reworked. Both the spellswap and the sequencer choice are done at random
      (though occasionally I've tweaked it for specific mages) - I think an 18th
      level wizard has about 4000 different possible combinations of contingencies
      and sequencers! Spell choices will change each time you reinstall <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
      II</acronym>; sequencer and contingency choices will change each time you
      reload.
      <p> Note that no 10th level spells (i.e., <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s)
        are added by this component. </p> 
    </li> 
    <li>Much better targeting. <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> mages are very, very careful to choose sensible targets
        for their spells and to avoid silly or unrealistic actions. They will
        renew magic defences as soon as they are destroyed, try to show some
        discernment in when to use antimagic attacks, prefer to target fighters
        with Dire Charm and mages with Power Word: Kill, etc. Multi-class characters
        will try to intersperse their mage and non-mage abilities. There is quite
        a lot of randomness, though - partly because it's tactically unwise to
        use too-fixed a strategy, but mostly for variety.
      <p> <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> tries
        extremely hard not to cheat. It's impossible within the engine to be
        completely certain of this, but as far as I can manage, no <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym> mage does anything that the party can't (assuming that you
        have installed the Spell Tweaks components of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
        II</acronym>). There are two exceptions: </p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>As noted in the "Improved Fiends" component, if you install that
          component then <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-summoned
          fiends behave a little differently from <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>-summoned
          ones. </li> 
        <li>I assume that <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> wizards
          (who have years and decades more practice than the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>)
          can specify the conditions on which their contingencies go off with
          more discernment than the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>,
          so I haven't restricted myself to the conditions that the game allows
          for <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> spellcasters. Otherwise,
          I have kept to the standard Contingency rules even when the unmodded
          game breaks them (no choosing different targets in the same sequencer;
          no 9th level spells in Chain Contingency, etc.) </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> mages
        obey the rules on invisibility: only spells which can be cast at a point
        on the ground can be used against improved-invisible opponents. So they
        will cast Horrid Wilting or Fireball at your improved-invisible character,
        but not Breach or Magic Missile. One unavoidable game-engine, glitch,
        though, is that (unlike with <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> spells)
        an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>-cast Fireball
        will land at the feet of its target even if s/he has moved after casting
        began. I can't do much about this. Note that sequencers cannot be, and
        are not, targetted at invisible opponents (even if they contain area-effect
        spells); but note also that liches can see through invisibility (even
        in the unmodded game). </p>
      <p> Out of mercy, enemy mages won't cast Imprisonment on the main character.
        If you're masochistic enough to want to change this, enter CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("DMWWImprisonPlayer","GLOBAL",1). </p> 
    </li> 
    <li><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> allows
      mages to cast some spells instantly, to simulate casting before battle
      begins (in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> it's very difficult
      to script enemies to do the sort of pre-battle buffing that <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym>s
      can do). They will always do this with any spell with a duration of more
      than a couple of hours (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> Stoneskin,
      Melf's Minute Meteors). There are three options, though, for the casting
      of short duration spells. (Note that whichever option you choose, mages
      will still use contingencies and spell sequencers.)
      <ul> 
        <li><strong>Option 1: </strong>Mages are always allowed to cast spells
          instantly at the start of combat. This is basically the same way magic
          works in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Tutu or Baldur's Gate Trilogy">SCS</acronym>,
          and is tactically the hardest challenge; however, on occasion it might
          appear a bit unrealistic. </li> 
        <li><strong>Option 2: </strong>Mages are allowed to cast spells instantly
          at the start of combat only when they are created near the <acronym title="Player Character">PC</acronym> (<acronym title="Exempli Gratia">e.g.</acronym> enemy
          mages teleporting in to ambush you). This is basically how Tactics
          handles this (though I think I keep to the rules more strictly than
          Tactics does). It's somewhat less challenging, but since even casters
          whom you catch off-guard have contingencies and sequencers to defend
          themselves with, mages can slam up defences pretty quickly. </li>
        <li><strong>Option 3: </strong>Mages never cast spells instantly. (Though,
          again, they can very quickly use contingencies and sequencers to defend
          themselves.) </li> 
      </ul> 
    </li> 
  </ol> 
  This component also makes some systematic adjustments in the levels of <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym>s.
  The unmodded game is very inconsistent: it often makes casters much too-low-level
  for the spells they have (this matters because many spells have different effects
  at different levels, and also because Dispel Magic depends on the difference
  in levels between the casters. <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
  II</acronym> goes through every arcane caster in the game and modifies their
  level according to the following rule: an <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> is
  raised to the lowest level consistent with all the spells s/he knows, except
  that no-one is raised to a level that would let them cast higher-level spells
  than they actually have, and (almost) no-one has their level reduced by <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
  II</acronym>. As of version 10 of this mod, this is fine-tuned manually in the case of a few already-high-level wizards who were arguably
  being raised to too-high levels.
  <p>Also as of version 10, many wizards will be specialists of one sort or another
  (I use necromancers, conjurers, invokers and enchanters), and this should - hopefully - lead to a little more variety in the kind of spell use you see.</p>
  <p>The component uses whatever memorization rules are in the game. If you've installed a component which changes the number of spells a caster of a given level
  can learn, this will apply to enemy mages too.</p>
  <p> Since Irenicus is a mage, this component upgrades him too. He gains no
    new spells, but he should use his existing spells more effectively, and this
    makes him a lot more dangerous (particularly in his final incarnation). Illasera
    is a fighter-mage in the unmodded (non-Ascension) game, so if you don't install
    Ascension then she gets upgraded. If you have the "Smarter Clerics" component
    then Sendai is also upgraded (unless you've installed "Tougher Sendai" from the Oversight mod). </p>
    <p><strong>Add high-level abilities (<acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s)
      to <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> priests</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Add high-level abilities (<acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s)
      to <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> priests</strong></p> 
  <p>These work exactly the same as the equivalent mage components, but for priests.
  <p><strong>Smarter Priests</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the intelligence of the clerics and fighter-clerics
    in the game, in much the same way as the "Smarter Mages" component does for
    mages etc. It has the same three pre-casting options; note, though, that
    since clerics do not have access to sequencers or contingencies, enemy clerics
    are at a huge disadvantage on options 2 or 3. </p> 
  <p><strong>Smarter Illasera</strong></p>
This component changes the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the Ascension version of Illasera (and her flunkies) to match the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> norm. Hopefully this makes them more rather than less dangerous (although Ascension <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is pretty good, so I'd welcome feedback - the first version, I think, was quite a lot less difficult than the Ascension baseline).
<p>This component has no effect on the non-Ascension version of Illasera (who is a standard fighter/mage and gets modified by the "Smarter Mages" component). Both the original and the finale versions are affected.
  <p><strong>Smarter Yaga-Shura</strong></p> 
This component changes the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the Ascension version of Yaga-Shura (and his flunkies) to match the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> norm. Hopefully this makes them more rather than less dangerous (although Ascension <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is pretty good, so I'd welcome feedback). Both the original and the finale versions are affected.
<p>This component has no effect on the non-Ascension version of Yaga-Shura (who is a standard fighter and gets modified by the "Smarter General <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>" component).
<p><strong>Smarter Abazigal</strong></p>
This component tries to upgrade the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of Abazigal. 
Both his humanoid and dragon forms are affected; if you have Ascension installed, so is the finale form of Abazigal, and so is his companion Tamah. I try to systematise Abazigal's magical talents a bit, but I don't do anything for which there isn't some existing in-game justification.
  <p><strong>Smarter Gromnir</strong></p> 
This component changes the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of the Ascension version of Gromnir Il-Khan (and his flunkies) to match the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> norm. Hopefully this makes them more rather than less dangerous (although Ascension <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> is pretty good, so I'd welcome feedback). Both the original and the finale versions are affected.
<p>This component has no effect on the non-Ascension version of Gromnir (who is a standard fighter and gets modified by the "Smarter General <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>" component).
<p><strong>Smarter Melissan</strong></p>
This component upgrades the <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> of Melissan, in both her Ascension and non-Ascension forms. I try fairly hard to use only those abilities she demonstrates in-game, although I do fix a bug in the non-Ascension version of Melissan whereby her last form wasn't using quite the right script.
<p><strong>Ascension demons use<acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> abilities and  <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ascension versions of Irenicus and Sendai use <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> abilities and  <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym></strong></p>
These components do exactly what they say: they modify these aspects of Ascension to fit the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> norm. (Note that only the chapter 10 version of Sendai is affected: the chapter 9 version will use <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS  II</acronym> scripting anyway.)
<h3>Tactical Challenges</h3>
Though the distinction isn't hard-and-fast, components in this section are less concerned with improving the intelligence of creatures, more concerned with increasing their abilities and numbers. (Though hopefully, creatures remain intelligent and changes remain fairly low-key.)
  <p><strong>Make the starting dungeon slightly harder</strong></p>
  <p>This is a very low-key modification to the initial dungeon. It replaces the pathetic goblins with duergar (which I think has a better "feel" to
  it in any case) and it prevents you from sleeping more than once. (I allow you to sleep once because (i) it gives you a chance to choose your spells, and
  (ii) Imoen has some rest-related dialogue that I don't want to block.)</p>


  <p><strong>Improved Shade Lord</strong></p>
  <p>This component upgrades the Shade Lord, mostly by giving him additional
    magical powers (though his hit points are also increased). Unlike most <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> components, this one doesn't make any particular effort to stick
    with the vanilla game or with anything from <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> source
    material: like the Wolf of Ulcaster, the Shade Lord has his own unique abilities.</p> 



  <p><strong>Spellcasting Demiliches</strong></p> 
  <p> This component (which requires "smarter mages") makes demiliches more like
    their third-edition versions. The demilich Imprisonment ability has been
    nerfed: it now grants a saving throw vs. death at -5, although it also causes
    level drain even on a successful save. Demiliches are still 100% immune to
    magic, but they are not additionally immune to spells of L6 or above (this
    means that high-level antimagic works on them). </p>
  <p>On the other hand, demiliches are now by-the-book 35th level wizards with
    significantly accelerated casting times. (Only the demilich in <acronym title="Watcher's Keep">WK</acronym> has
    access to <acronym title="High-Level Ability">HLA</acronym>s.) The net effect
    should be to make demiliches quite significantly more dangerous - I would
    be unsurprised to discover that Kangaxx is now beyond most <acronym title="Shadows of Amn">SoA</acronym> parties,
    though I'd welcome feedback on this. </p> 
    <p>As of version 10, Demiliches can use their Imprisonment ability and cast a spell in the same round.</p>


  <p><strong>More Resilient Trolls</strong></p>
  <p>This component tries to turn trolls' regeneration from a minor book-keeping
    nuisance to a genuine threat. Trolls still collapse when reduced close to
    death, and still require fire or acid to finish them off - but a more significant
    amount of damage is needed (ranging from 2 hit points for ice trolls to 8
    hit points for spirit trolls) and they will get up again (at partial strength
    only) much more quickly.</p> 
  <p>This component probably isn't for everyone. Some will find it tactically
    and role-playing-ly interesting; others will find it a chore.</p> 

   <p><strong>Increase difficulty of level-dependent monster groupings</strong></p>
  <p>At various points in the unmodded game, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> chooses
    the strength of the monsters you face based on your level. Typically there
    are four encounters, and which one you get depends on your experience level. </p>
  <p>This component causes the game to give you somewhat tougher choices; there
    are four options available. &quot;Mildly increased difficulty&quot; causes
    you to get a fight one step too high-level for you; &quot;significantly increased
    difficulty&quot; gives you a fight two steps too high, and &quot;almost-maximum
    difficulty&quot; gives you the hardest possible fight whatever your level
    (with one exception: see below). Other ability-dependent components are modified
    in a similar way to try to achieve the same effects.</p> 
  <p> The only exception to the general rule is the "spawn-undead" script, whose
    highest-level setting causes liches to spawn. <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> liches are so much more powerful than vanilla ones that it is
    nearly suicidal to take them on at lower levels (at least without cheesy
    tactics), so even on the "almost-maximum difficulty" setting they don't spawn
    unless you have at least 1 million XP. If you really, really want a massively-hard-to-injure
    undead archmage dumping Pit Fiends and Horrid Wiltings on you at 8th level,
    install the fourth option, "maximum difficulty". </p> 
  <p>This component is rather like the "always tougher spawns" component of Tactics,
    but it's rather more customisable (and, since modding tools are much improved
    since Tactics was written, it installs in a way that's less likely to mess
    up other mods). </p> 

  <p><strong>Improved Random Encounters</strong></p> 
  <p>This component adds a little more variety and challenge to the "You have
    been waylaid by enemies" encounters. The main point of this component was
    not so much to make random encounters more difficult (though it does that
    too, to some extent) as to make them less repetitive - there are now about
    a dozen encounters, and the order in which they occur is somewhat randomised.</p> 


  <p><strong>Improved D'Arnise Keep</strong></p> 
  <p>This component, though not identical to the "Tougher Torgal" component of
    Tactics, is strongly influenced by it. It adds more trolls to the keep, upgrades
    Torgal a bit, and gives Spirit trolls some magical abilities. The main differences
    from the Tactics version are more detailed targeting for the spirit trolls,
    a wider variety of troll reinforcements (not just spirit trolls) and a (hopefully!)
    cleverer, but slightly less tough, Torgal (who, in this version, has not
    stolen one of the flail heads). </p> 
  <p>As of version 2, the magical powers of spirit trolls are optional; purists
    can choose to get the original, non-spellcasting spirit trolls. </p> 



  <p><strong>Improved Faldorn</strong></p>
  <p>This component makes Faldorn into a by-the-book sixteenth level avenger. She has no special powers (and begins the druid duel unbuffed, as
    does your character) but hopefully her kit powers mean that she's still reasonably
    effective. </p>
  <p><strong>Improved Unseeing Eye</strong></p>
  <p>The original Unseeing Eye is actually a fairly ineffectual high-level spellcaster. This component shifts it into an Elder Orb (I assume that, just as the Eye grants
  magical sight to its blind followers, so it grants itself the magical use of its eyestalks even though strictly it's blind; I do assume its central eye is inoperative, though) and makes it virtually immune to damage (Demilich-level immunities)
  until the Rift device is used. Even once the device is used, the Eye will still put up a reasonable fight.</p>

  <p><strong>Improved Bodhi (Tactics remix)</strong></p>
  <p>This component is very closely based on the Improved Bodhi in Westley Weimer's
    Tactics mod. To quote from the readme to that mod: </p>
  <p><em>Sigh. Bodhi is worth 91K <acronym title="Experience Points">XP</acronym> --
      more than almost anything else in the game. And yet she is a mere brute-force
      melee fighter who doesn't even drink healing potions. We make her more
      intelligent ... and give her some impressive pseudo-magical powers associated
      with vampires of myth and legend. Bodhi gains dominion over bats, the cold,
      the ground and the grave.</em> </p>
  <p>The <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> version
    of Improved Bodhi is updated to use modern <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> coding
    (to help with compatibility-friendliness) and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripting.
    She comes in two versions: a "hardcore" version which has the same stats
    and powers as Westley's version, and a toned-down version with stats closer
    to Bodhi's vanilla-game stats, less ferocious saving-throw penalties for
    her spells (-4 instead of -10) and no Deathly Shroud (Bodhi's lethal Fire
    Shield power). </p>
  <p>You can fight Bodhi in chapters 3 and 6; in chapter 3 (again, following
    Tactics) she'll pull her punches, slightly more so in the toned-down version
    than the hardcore one.</p>


  <p> <strong>Party's items are taken from them in Spellhold</strong></p>
  This component does essentially what it says: when the party are captured in
  chapter 4, their equipment is taken from them and they have to survive the
  maze beneath Spellhold without it. (They have an opportunity to reclaim it
  before the final battle of chapter 4). A small amount of nonmagical equipment is available relatively
    quickly in the Asylum. Players (even solo players) might want to note that
    Imoen does carry the Enchanted Weapon spell. </p>
    <p>As of version 16 of SCSII, there is a `hardcore' version of this component available. In this version, you don't receive
    a small stash of items shortly after entering the Asylum, and you don't get to retrieve your equipment until after the final battle
    of chapter 4. (This was implemented by a request from Loz, so you know who to blame if it's impossible!)</p>
  <p> This component is rather similar to a component of the "Big Picture" mod,
    but it's coded rather differently: most importantly, it creates a dynamic
    list of all the items in the game, which should prevent the "missing-item" bugs
    that caused some problems with the Big Picture component. It's compatible
    with the Big Picture version in the following sense: if you install the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> version after the <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> version, <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> dynamic-item-generation will be added to the <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> version
    but that version will otherwise be left alone. Don't install the <acronym title="Big Picture">BP</acronym> version
    after the <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> version, though. </p>
  <p> <strong>Improved fight with Irenicus in Spellhold</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves the clones summoned by Irenicus in the end-of-chapter-4 battle (see the Spoilers for details).</p>

  <p><strong>Improved Sahuagin</strong></p>
This component improves all sahuagin in the game (but especially the ones in the sunken city). No new creatures are added, and no special powers are granted, but the sahuagin statistics are systematised and generally improved slightly, and their scripting is smarter. Various clues in the vanilla game suggest that sahuagin priestesses are cleric/mages; I take this seriously and give significant cleric and mage magic to all of them. (The main priestesses in the game are now L18/16 cleric-mages and are reasonably challenging; the minor ones are somewhat lower level).
<p>Overall, this component should be a bit more difficult than the vanilla sahuagin, but nothing like as powerful as Tactics' Improved Sahuagin.
 
  <p><strong>Improved beholder hive</strong></p>
This component (adapted from Quest Pack) adds a few extra beholders to the hive in the Underdark, notably including a Hive Mother.

<p><strong>Prevent resting in the illithid city</strong></p>
This component does just what it says it does: it prevents you from sleeping in the city. This is partly on role-playing grounds (it's blatantly implausible that you could rest there), partly on tactical grounds (a party at the kind of level that's likely to enter the city can protect everyone with Chaotic Commands, nullifying most illithid powers. This will force you to ration your protections a bit, and to be more creative.</p>
<p><strong>Slightly Improved Drow</strong></p>
This component makes a number of small improvements to the drow of chapter 5 (it doesn't affect the drow of Sendai's enclave). It slightly increases the combat proficiency of drow soldiers, it adds a few extra drow to one of the Underdark ambushes and a few extra priests to the Ghaunadans; it improves the drow battlegroup defending the doors to the Underdark; it slightly optimises House Jae'llat nobles and adds one more noble and a few commoner priests and mages.
<p>Notably, it also <b>dramatically</b> beefs up the defences of Ust Natha (as of version 8, this is an optional subcomponent). The place is a drow <b>city</b>, not the kind of place that even a 15th level adventuring party should be able to wipe out. Now, more defenders will continuously spawn.  For the first twenty rounds or so, this will be disorganised, low-level groups. After that, the drow will get more organised and start sending serious war-parties against the party. Eventually truly powerful groups of mages and high priestesses will turn up.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: this component is <b>not</b> intended to make the conquest of the drow city somewhat more interesting and challenging: it is meant to make it virtually impossible. I predict that it will be enormously difficult for any party to defeat all of the drow and conquer Ust Natha. The sane thing to do is to get out as soon as you can; even that will probably be a bit trickier than usual. 
<p>Players who do want a challenging but doable battle to conquer Ust Natha can make it more manageable at the console; see the Console section for details.

<p><strong>Improved Watcher's Keep</strong></p>
This component makes small changes to a few areas in Watcher's Keep to make them more tactically interesting. It's a work in progress: expect more to be added in later releases. The changes (as usual for this mod) aren't too dramatic; they shouldn't change the feel of the place much. See the spoilers section for details.

<p><strong>Improved Battle with Irenicus in Hell</strong></p>
<p>As with Improved Bodhi, this is a <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> version
    of the classic Tactics component of the same name by Wesley Weimer,  updated to use modern <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> coding
    (to help with compatibility-friendliness) and <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> scripting. It also tweaks a few details of the battle.
<p>Players of the original Improved Irenicus will recall that it consists of three successive fights (of which the first is generally felt to be much the best). In this
version, you can choose (at install time) to have either (i) all three battles, or (ii) a hybrid version, consisting of the first Tactics battle followed by
<acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II's</acronym> version of the battle (which is the unmodified-game battle, but with <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> scripting and fiend abilities. I say more about this in the Spoilers section.


  <p><strong>Improved Fire Giant Temple</strong></p>
  This component improves various aspects of the Yaga-Shura part of chapter 8.
  Fire giants acquire some high-level abilities; elemental creatures are slightly
  improved and given better scripts; a couple of bonus monsters are added.

  <p><strong>Improved Sendai's Enclave</strong></p>
  <p>This component improves a number of sections of the approach to Sendai.
    Drow spellcasters become slightly higher-level and can summon more dangerous
    allies; the drow war-parties are tougher and reinforced by other creatures;
    the illithid ambush is less of a joke. Also, the final battle with Sendai
    is modified: no actual creature in the battle is altered at all (though other
    components of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> will alter them) but the statues activate and attack in a more
    efficient fashion. </p> 

  <p><strong>Improved Abazigal's Lair</strong></p> 
  This component (which has been drastically changed in version 6) improves some parts of Abazigal's lair by adding several new encounters and
  toughening up the existing ones. See the spoilers for details.


  <p><strong>Improved minor encounters</strong></p> 
  <p>This component slightly improves the difficulty of a small number of encounters
    scattered across the game (see spoilers for details).</p>

<h2> <a name="console" id="console">Power-user options (contains spoilers)</a> </h2>
<div class="section">
A certain amount of "fine tuning" of <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> is available over and above your install options via the console. (For those who don't know, the console can be accessed by (1) adding the line "Cheats=1" (without the quote marks) to the baldur.ini file in your BG2 directory, just below the line "[Game Options]", and then (2) pressing CTRL-SPACE in-game.)
<p>
The options are all controlled by setting certain global variables, which is done by typing this command:
<p>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("[Global to set]","GLOBAL",[value to set it to])
<p>
So for instance, to set the variable SeduceBodhi to 3, type
<p>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("SeduceBodhi","GLOBAL",3).
<p>
The variables that can be set in <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> are these (all start as 0):
<ul>
<li>DMWWImprisonPlayer - set to 1 if you want enemy spellcasters to try using Imprisonment on your main character (which, be warned, ends the game if they succeed).
<li>DMWWBeholderDisintegrate - set to 1 if you want beholders to use their Disintegrate eyestalk. 
<li>DMWWBeholderDisintegrateSR - set to 1 if you are using Spell Revisions and you want beholders <b>not</b> to use their Disintegrate eyestalk.
<li>DMWWDisableBeholderTheft - set to 1 if you want to prevent beholders trying to steal certain items with their telekinesis eyestalk
<li>DMWWReduceDemonSummoning - set to 1 if you don't want enemy wizards summoning Glabrezus
<li>DMWWDisableBuffing - set to 1 to stop mages and priests doing any pre-battle spellcasting. (Obviously, if you want this switched off all the time then just don't install the prebuffing component; this is to turn it off for any specific fights that you don't feel should have prebuffing. Don't forget to turn it on again.)
<li>DMWWNeutralPrebuff - set to 1 to allow neutral mages and priests to have long-term defences like Stoneskin in place, rather than insta-casting them when they go 
hostile. (Arguably this is more realistic, but it can be offputting.) Note that the default behaviour has been reversed as of version 10.
<li>DMWWDrowCityLite - set to 1 or 2 (in decreasing order of difficulty) to make the defenders of Ust Natha less overwhelming. (See the Drow section in "additional notes on contact" for details, but roughly, each reduces the number of ordinary drow by about 3/4 and halves the number of elite drow.)
<li>DMWWDemorgorgonTS - set to 1 if you want to enable Demogorgon's Time Stop power.
<li>DMWWDemogorgonHost - set to 1 if you want Demogorgon to summon a host of demons at the start of the fight.
<li>DMWWIINoRest - set to 1 if you don't want your party to be fully healed between part 1 and part 2 of the improved battle with Irenicus in Hell
<li>DMWWIIStealStuff - set to 1 if you want to restore the Tactics feature of Irenicus in Hell where he steals five of your magical items at the start of the battle
<li>DMWWIISpawn - set to 2 if you want all the fragments of Irenicus in Hell to spawn allies every few rounds (this was default behaviour
on Insane difficulty in the Tactics version), or to 1 if you want to stop liches spawning but allow other spawns.
<li>DMWWNoTimestopMelee - set to 1 if you want to prevent enemy fighter-mages from attacking during Timestop spells (this mostly affects Irenicus in Hell). Set to 2 if
you additionally want to prevent (the SCSII version of) Melissan attacking during Timestops. (This will also prevent Melissan attacking during *your* timestops, and is
pretty exploitable.)
<li>DMWWBonusMerchantSpawn - set to 3 if you're bored of waiting for Joluv and Deirdre to show up.
<li>DMWWNoSkeletonDetonate - set to 1 if you don't want illithids' psionic detonation to destroy skeletons.
<li>DMWWDisintegratePlayer - set to 1 if you want SR mages to use Disintegrate on Player 1, to 2 if you want them to use Disintegrate Spell Triggers on Player 1.
</ul>
<p>It's also possible to make a few more fine-tuned install options by editing the file scsii/scsii.ini. (This must be done <b>before</b> installing the mod.) This file can be edited in a text editor.
Each line consists of a configuration option, then a space, then a number. The only thing you should edit is the number.</p>
<p>The current configuration options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mage_Level_Add - this value (which can be positive or negative) is added to the level of all mages in the game (subject to a minimum level of 1 and a maximum of 40).
<li>Mage_Level_Scale - this value (which must be a positive integer, and defaults to 100) is applied as a percentage scale to the level of all mages in the game 
(subject to a minimum level of 1 and a maximum of 40). So if you set it to 125, all mages will be 25 percent higher level than in the baseline install. Mage_Level_Scale is evaluated before Mage_Level_Add.
<li>Mage_Level_No_Adjustments - set this to 1 if you want to disable all scaling of mage levels. I don't really recommend doing this: many wizards in the game have very weird levels.</li>
<li>Mage_Ignore_SR - set this to 1 if you have Spell Revisions installed but you don't want SCSII mages to make allowance for Spell Revisions spells. (This might be useful if, for instance, you've customised Spell Revisions and as a result, SCSII doesn't work.)</li>
<li>Priest_Level_Add, Priest_Level_Scale, Priest_Level_No_Adjustments, Priest_Ignore_SR - as above, but for priests
<li>Sendai_Component_Is_Sendai_Only - this is a favour to Loz. If set to 1, the Sendai's Enclave component only enhances the final encounter with Sendai.
<li>AI_Does_Not_Detect_Items - set this to 1 if you want to experiment with the computer not being able to tell when your magic items protect you. (This will probably cause some odd behaviour.)
<li>Conceal_Prebuff_Spell_Names - set this to 1 if you don't want pre-buffing wizards and priests to display strings like "Stoneskin (cast previously)" when their buffs go up.
<li>Force_No_HLA_Repeats - set this to 1 if you have a mod (like Vilkacis') installed that allows wizards and priests to learn HLAs as if they were innate abilities rather than spells, and you 
don't want enemy wizards and priests to take more than one of each ability. (If you're planning on taking more than one of each yourself, be ashamed.)
<li>Disable_ToBEx - set this to one to disable ToB Extender. (If you don't know what this means, don't do it.)
<li>Disable_Hacks_If_ToBEx_Skipped - set this to one to prevent Taimon's hacks being used as a backup if ToBEx is disabled. (If you don't know what this means, don't do it.)
<li>Disable_SSL_compilation - set this to 1 if you want to stop Stratagems Scripting Language scripts from being compiled. (Never do this, it will break the game. It's only for my convenience.)

  <p>The Cloak of Mirroring is now worn by the demilich of Watcher's Keep. (Don't ask me how a demilich can wear a cloak;

 </ul> 
In addition, Demogorgon has a gaze attack (either a charm or a confusion effect) which he can use each round in addition to his spells. My original version of Demogorgon also had a Time Stop usable once per day (as in Ascension) but I worried that this was too much; if you want to turn this back on, enter SetGlobal("DMWWDemogorgonTS","GLOBAL",1) at the console.
<p><strong>Smarter Beholders</strong></p>
The beholders can now use their telekinesis power to steal the Cloak of Mirroring and the Shield of Balduran. They don't do it in the first couple of rounds, then they have a 1/3 chance per round (per beholder). The idea isn't to make the items useless but to block the move of just giving them to one person and sending them in. If it annoys you, you can turn it off at the console: set DMWWDisableBeholderTheft to 1.</p>

<p><strong>Improved Irenicus in Spellhold</strong></p>
The clones are now direct copies of the party.
<p><strong>Improved Irenicus in Hell</strong></p>
Irenicus originally splits into five copies:
<ul>
<li>The <b>Dragon of Pride</b>, basically a clone of the Shadow Dragon
<li>The <b>Orb of Fear</b>, a beholder with some initial defensive buffs 
(Blade Barrier, Spell Turning, Fire Shields, Spell Immunity: Abjuration, and Protection from Magic Weapons)
and with its central (antimagic) eye replaced by a ray that reduces Constitution. (The original one instead used randomly selected eyestalk powers 
from a list including basically every beholder-kin power in the game.)
<li>The <b>Wraith of Wrath</b>, a magic-immune warrior whose blows drain 2 points of strength per hit
<li>The <b>Sword of Greed</b>, an ultrapowerful, regenerating version of Mordenkainen's Sword whose blows drain 4 levels per hit and boost the Sword itself
<li> <b>Selfish Jon</b> (not a name used in-game), a version of Irenicus who is a 25th level wizard with immunity to damaging magic and greatly improved casting time, and a new spell - "shatter
magic" which is basically an ultrapowerful dispel. (The original version had permanent Improved Alacrity, but chose spells randomly from a list instead of getting a proper
spell book.)
</ul>
<p>After that, you get an autosave, and (unless you set "DMWWIINoRest" to 1 at the console) everyone gets resurrected and healed. Then you get either the original Tactics 2nd and 3rd round (see that mod for details) or the SCSII standard Irenicus battle.
Note that the Dragon, the Orb, and Selfish Jon only get SCSII scripting if you've installed the appropriate AI components (otherwise the original version is used).</p>
<p>In the original version, each of the fragments steals an item from you (the Dragon takes the Amulet of Power, the Orb takes the Shield of Balduran, the Wraith takes
Crom Faeyr, the Sword takes Weimer's "Acid Kensai" sword, and Selfish Jon takes the Cloak of Mirroring). I find this a bit unrealistic so it's disabled by default; you can 
re-enable it by setting "DMWWIIStealStuff" to 1 at the console.</p>
<p>Also in the original version, on Insane difficulty the fragments all spawn allies - wraiths for the Wraith, beholders for the Orb, wyverns for the Dragon, Mordenkainen's Swords
for the Sword, and liches for Selfish Jon. I tie this to a variable rather than the difficulty slider: it's off by default, but setting DMWWIISpawn to 2 enables all spawning
and setting it to 1 enables all spawning except for liches.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Watcher's Keep</strong></p>
The statues on level one are rearranged: a fighter becomes a thief, a random monster becomes a high-level mage, and an archer gets a proper archery script. Some random extra fiends are added to the teleport maze as random encounters for when you return to already-cleared areas. The two spellcasting glabrezu gain four brethren. The number of mind flayers in the lair on level four is greatly increased.
<p><strong>Improved Drow</strong></p>
The drow defenders of Ust Natha look like this:
<ul>
<li><b>Group A: disorganised raiders</b> (about every five rounds)
<ul>
<li>Three L9 fighters, two L9 archers, a L12/12 fighter/mage
<li>Two L9 fighters, two L9 archers
<li>Four L9 fighters, two L9 archers, a L10 cleric
<li>Four L9 fighters, a L11 mage
</ul>
<li><b>Group B: serious war-parties</b> (every four rounds)<br>
Each party comprises six L9 fighters, four L9 archers, a L10 cleric, a L14 cleric, a L12/12 fighter/cleric, a L11 mage, and a L15 mage. There are four of these war-parties.
<li><b>Group C: elite battlegroups</b> (every ten rounds, with another Group B war-party between each battlegroup)
<ul>
<li>Four L9 fighters, three L17 mages
<li>Four L9 fighters, two L12/12 fighter/clerics, a L18 cleric, a L18 mage, a glabrezu, and two nabassu
<li>Two L11 mages, a L15 mage, a L22 mage, and four stone golems
<li>Six L9 fighters, two L10 clerics, two L12/12 fighter/clerics, a L14 cleric, a L20 cleric, two balors and two glabrezu.
</ul>
</ul> I will be favourably impressed if anyone beats that lot.
<p>If you want a tough fight but something a little less hideous, set DMWWDrowCityLite to 1 (in which case after group A you'll get two group-B war parties and the third and fourth elite groups) or to 2 (in which case after group A you'll get a group-B war party and the first and second elite groups).

 
  <p><strong>Improved Fire Giant Lair</strong></p> 
  Fire giants gain 2 <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> and
  elites gain 5; both become Berserkers. Flaming Skulls become tougher and get
  access to Stoneskin and more powerful fireballs, and Burning Men get a dispel-magic
  attack; both get a smarter script. One of the groups of fire creatures behind
  the force fields is replaced by a group of Efreeti and a Fire Lich (a creature
  removed from the original game). Imix becomes tougher and gets a Greater Whirlwind
  ability. A red dragon of about Firkraag's strength joins the giants in the
  inner temple.
  <p><strong>Improved Sendai's Enclave</strong></p> 
  <p>Drow mages are raised to 16th level; drow priests are raised to 17th level
    and gain a Gate spell that summons a Balor (summoning Pit Fiends isn't appropriate
    for the chaotic evil drow). The random (and weak) drow spawns in the city
    region of the enclave are replaced by two war parties - one backed up by
    glabrezu, one by beholders. Odamaron gets two apprentices (one vampire, one lich) and two skeleton 	warriors. 
	The pathetic illithid ambush is replaced by two
    battles: one with the vampiric illithids reinforced by three more illithids
    with umber-hulk guards, one with a three-stage illithid strike force consisting
    of human thralls, illithids, and ulitharids supported by umber hulks. Sendai's
    statues animate once per round whether or not the previous one is dead. </p> 
  <p><strong>Improved Abazigal's Lair</strong></p> 
  The Earth Elementals are replaced by Lizard Men, as are the Salamanders. A
  strike force of baatezu (two pit fiends, four cornugons) attacks the party
  on their way back from collecting the Breath Potion. All eyes except the eagle
  eyes get better targetting; the sentinels now summon much tougher monsters
  (elementals, mordenkainen's swords, efreeti, and skeleton warriors). A strike
  force of tyrant golems (golem beholders; lots of <acronym title="hit ponts">HP</acronym> and
  100% <acronym title="Magic Resistance">MR</acronym>) and undead beholders protects
  the entrance to Iycanth's sanctum.
<p>More importantly, there are two new encounters with dragons. The bone fiend area where the Breath Potion is has been replaced with the lair of a yellow dragon (and L20-odd mage) who was ousted by Abazigal. You have to fight the dragon one way or another, but depending on how the conversation goes, it may not be to the death. There is a rather nice item available if you play nice, and the dragon's scales if you play nasty.
<p>
Part way through the lair, you'll have to return to town. On coming back, there will be a posse of dragons waiting for you: two black dragons, then a green dragon, and finally a red dragon.
<p>
The dragon encounters have (for a tactical mod) a reasonable amount of dialogue; I welcome feedback on it (and everything else, as usual.)
  <p><strong>Improved minor encounters</strong></p>
  <ul> 
    <li>The Twisted Rune's fighter Revanek gets some equipment (this is almost
      a bugfix) and Vaxall the beholder becomes an Elder Orb. (code borrowed
      from Quest Pack with thanks). </li> 
    <li>The Guarded Compound fighters become, respectively, a berserker and a
      barbarian, and the traps in the compound no longer affect the slavers. </li>
    <li>The Murderers who work with Irenicus are upgraded to 7th level thieves </li>
    <li>A few extra creatures are added to the Druid Grove (code borrowed from
      Tactics with thanks)</li> 
    <li>Imix is now immune to his own traps</li> 
    <li>The Unseeing Eye guards are slightly tougher.</li> 
    <li>The elemental guardians of the Underdark portals are slightly tougher and have some magical abilities and some sidekicks.
    <li>The defenders of the temple of Talos (if you do the good cleric quest) have been upgraded: there are more Storm Knights and a temple mage, and the Knights are now cleric/fighters.
    <li>Nyalee gets a Mirror of Opposition that can make hostile copies of party members. The skeleton warriors in her area get the normal skeleton-warrior resistances.
    <li>The Docks muggers are now thieves (not fighter/thieves) and don't endlessly respawn.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><a name="known" id="known">Known Issues</a> </h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <ul> 
    <li><acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS II</acronym> has
      some extremely long scripts. This may cause lagging on older computers;
      even on newer ones, the game may lag momentarily on entering an area, or
      when a creature (especially a mage) appears or begins combat. </li> 
    <li>Every string referring to the original cost of going to Spellhold needs
      to be modified manually; this means that there may well be third-party
      mod content which still refers to the old amounts. Let me know if you find
      any and I'll allow for it in future releases. </li>
    <li>I have occasional reports of wizards renewing their buffs and contingencies when they go out of sight. I'm unable to reproduce this bug locally.
    If you get it <b>and can reproduce it</b>, please let me know, in as much detail as you can.</li>
    <li>I have occasional reports of the "Visit Watcher's Keep between SoA and ToB" component causing problems (i.e., shifting you into ToB early) if you visit
    WK in chapter 2, 3 or 6. If you get this, please let me know, in as much detail as you can.</li>

<div class="section"> 
  <p>Firstly, many thanks to Gibberlings Three, and especially Cam, for hosting!</p> 
  <p>Huge thanks of course to Westley Weimer, who created an astonishingly flexible
    and powerful mod editor for <acronym 
title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games, and to the bigg for his modifications
    to that editor (many of which are essential for <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym>). Many thanks also to the creators of the <a 
href="http://iesdp.gibberlings3.net/">Infinity Engine Structure Description Project</a>,
    which clarified what the hell was going on several dozen times; and to Jon
    Hauglid, for Near Infinity.</p>
  <p>I'm grateful to SimDing0 for permission to borrow the beholder eyestalk
    code and a few other fragments from Quest Pack, to Westley Weimer (again)
    for general inspiration and more concretely for letting me borrow Improved
    Bodhi and Irenicus to make <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> versions (and a few other bits of Tactics too), and to other tactical-mod writers for the many fragments
    of inspiration that <acronym title="Sword Coast Stratagems for Baldur's Gate II">SCS
    II</acronym> borrowed from their mods.</p>
      <p>I'm also very grateful to Demivrgvs, Gort, Lemernis, Salk, and especially
    Coaster, all of whom beta-tested the mod and provided much useful feedback
    and many bug reports.
  <p>Thanks to Nythrun for some very useful code-optimisation tips, and to Steve, for his patience in helping me produce a Mac-friendly version. </p> 
<p>Many thanks to the translators: Leonardo Watson, ClanDLAN, and Yarpen.
    <p>Some bits of version 10 are directly based on code and/or ideas from Taimon, Mike1072 and Demivrgvs, for which many thanks.</p>
    <p>For version 10, I'm also particularly grateful to Temujin, Avenger_RR and Stworca for their very detailed lists of bugs and feedback.</p>
    <p>For version 16, I'm grateful to Ascension64, both for providing the remarkable ToB Extender, and for indulging my request to include it as part of an SCSII install.
    <p>Beyond that, thanks to the players and modders - too many to name - who've played and commented.</p>
  <p>And finally, as always I'm very grateful to Hannah Wallace for putting up
    with all this... </p>

<li>Some priest optimisation: Sanctuary is given to all priests above L7, and Bless/Chant are moved down the caster pecking order

<li>New Italian translation (courtesy Stoneangel)
<li>Updated to WEIDU v211
</ul>
<p>V 10 (August 2009):</p>
<b>New or heavily modified content</b>
<ul>
<li>Systematic rewriting of mage and priest components to generate spellbooks from scratch; lots of small tweaks to mage and priest targetting in the process
<li>New component: a BG2 version of the "modified shapeshifting" component from SCS
<li>New component: slightly harder Irenicus's Dungeon
<li>New component: Improved Irenicus in Hell (tactics remix)
<li>New component: improve the Spellhold fight with Irenicus
<li>New component: randomize the teleport maze in Watcher's Keep
<li>New component: give enemies a saving throw against Carsomyr's dispel-on-hit power (idea borrowed from Demivrgvs and Mike1072)
<li>New component: nerf resurrection rod
<li>New component: nerf Insect Plague (this is partly borrowed from Demivrgvs' Spell Revisions)
<li>New option in the "antimagic penetrates invisibility" component: restrict it to only affect some spells
<li>New components taken directly from Taimon's exe hacks: fix MI, fix Dispel Magic, make Stoneskin not change avatar colors
<li>New component: slightly increase the power of Mantle and the like
<li>New component: increase the cost of a mage license
<li>New component: require a license for casting spells in most above-ground areas in Athkatla
<li>Split the "detectable spells" component in two, so that players who don't want their items to be detected by the AI can choose for this not to happen
<li>Added new set of components to let the player choose exactly which strongholds s/he has access too (this is basically a fine-tuned version of the component in BG2Tweaks)
<li>"Remove arrows of dispelling from stores" is now its own component and not part of "improved minor encounters"; it now removes arrows from mod-added stores too
<li>Fll'yissetat and Adalon added to "smarter dragons"
<li>Updated German translation
</ul>
<b>Optimisations and minor tweaks and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Elder orbs no longer use Spell Shield
<li>The default for wizards is now only to force-cast Stoneskin when they go hostile, not as soon as they are created
<li>The disguised drow at Sendai's enclave now ignore calls for help from non-disguised drow
<li>By popular request, ulitharids are now >12th level. Blame Coaster.
<li>Following a suggestion of Galactygon, innate-casting creatures no longer have a casting animation
<li>Lizard Man shamans' contingencies now use 2xCreeping Doom, 1xADHW, not the other way around
<li>Slight tweaking of "improved random encounters": no encounter now occurs more than once, and the tough encounters occur one level later
<li>Golems are now listed as unintelligent
<li>The yuan-ti mages in the d'Arnise Keep have been slightly toned down (if you prefer the original ones, set the "DMWWTougherDarnise" global to 1)
<li>The "prevent characters from dying irreversibly" component has been renamed to "make characters less likely to die irreversibly"
<li>Dragons now use breath weapons on summoned enemies
<li>Dragons are less inclined to randomly run away
<li>Melissan's cambion had been left off the list of demons to be flagged as immune to pro/evil
<li>The Demon Knights in the Underdark now have proper help scripts
<li>Flagged lots of components as identical to components in SCS, so as to avoid duplicate installations on BGT installs
<li>Modified the move-Boo component so it's better suited to BGT installs
<li>Beholders now only use Simulacrum spells if the clone component is selected
<li>Under-the-hood change: the core melee and ranged-combat scripts now get new names rather than using the default names (WTASIGHT and WTARSGT). This should lead to various small smoothings - notably, it ought to stop joinables getting potions.
<li>The "move Boo" component now works for BG1 versions of Minsc (for BGT purposes) and allows for the "Kidnapping of Boo" quest in UB
<li>Some optimising of Genie scripting
<li>Tweaked black and shadow dragon breath-weapon use to hopefully be more effective
<li>Tweaked dragon melee strategy so they don't get locked into an only-attack loop and forget to use magic and breath weapons
<li>Enemy mages and priests now summon alignment-appropriate fiends (Baatezu for lawful evil, Tanar'ri for chaotic evil, random - but consistent - for neutral evil)
<li>Shapeshifted druids always go to melee (assuming "improved shapeshifting" isn't installed)
<li>The drow duelist mage and Qilue now get boosted by "improved Drow"
<li>The drow duelist mage no longer teleports out of the pit
<li>Irenicus in Spellhold now remembers to trigger his contingency before starting the spawn-clone tricks
<li>Mildly against my better judgment, added compatibility with SR Glitterdust
<li>Demiliches now can use their Trap-the-soul power even if they're spellcasting in the same round
<li>Irenicus and the Asylum mages now use magic against one another
<li>Added console option to prevent Irenicus et al from casting Timestop and then attacking the party
<li>Added Zallanora to the list of SoA mages who get HLAs
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes and compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Wand of Spell Striking is now edited so as not to penetrate invisibility in a manner compatible with Item Revisions
<li>Replaced a number of erroneous instances of "SPELLFAILUREMAGE" with "SPELLFAILUREPRIEST" in ease-of-use AI
<li>Corrected a few readme typos
<li>Incendiary Cloud traps no longer crash the game (second time lucky, I hope)
<li>Minor typo in the "remove sphere from cloak of mirroring" component (caught by Avenger_RR): the removal effect was labelled as "permanent", not just "while equipped"
<li>Corrected a few typos in the English version of the translation file
<li>"Smarter Gromnir" component now allows for players who have the core Ascension component but not "Tougher Gromnir" (or vice versa) installed
<li>Sendai's Enclave now installs even if "smarter mages" isn't installed
<li>Fixed some typos in "improved general AI" and "potions for NPCs" which were preventing some non-droppable potions from being used
<li>Killing the green dragon outside Abazigal's Lair in nothing flat will no longer prevent the red dragon from spawning
<li>Fixed a typo in Sendai's Enclave that was preventing Odamaron's traps from firing
<li>Fixed a typo in the transfer_item_abilities_to_spell macro (caught by Galactygon)
<li>Due to an error in my version of Near Infinity, the macro to make casting innate was erroneously giving immunity to Turn Undead(!)
<li>Thieves no longer hide in full view of invisible PCs (thanks to Kromgart for the suggestion of how to do this elegantly)
<li>Drow on the surface no longer have adamantine weapons
<li>Joinable NPC priests are now exempt from having their level altered by "smarter priests"
<li>The component that improves Ascension demons now requires Ascension to be installed
<li>The Yellow Dragon Armor now blocks thief skills
<li>Detectable Spells no longer crashes if ToB is not installed (not that SCSII supports non-ToB games, but still...)
<li>The hostile drow city component is less likely to stall now if the computer fails to notice that you've killed off the drow; we also fix a couple of typos
with the drow scripts
<li>If Oversight's "Tougher Sendai" is installed, SCSII leaves her alone (previously, we were getting compatibility bugs)
<li>The general AI now tries harder to pick on wounded opponents in melee
<li>Imix's "Starfire" power wasn't working, due to a typo (thanks, Temujin)

<li>Slightly modified the no-chunk component to be better at detecting PCs

<li>Golems now get immunity to poison
<li>Nevaziah's level is lowered to 18 (this makes the Edwin quest a little less frustratingly long)
<li>Under-the-hood change: "Faster Bears" now edits Creature files, not scripts (thanks to Ardanis for the code)
<li>"Dragons have more staying power" now improves hit points of dragons added by other components
<li>We now use Acid Arrows and Flame Arrows against enemies protected by Stoneskin

<li>The mage component will no longer fail in the (unlikely) event that some other mod adds a lich who is also a fighter/mage
<li>Removed an invisible "bug" in the Abazigal multi-dragon dialog (it wasn't causing in-game problems, but it was tripping bugfinding software)

<li>Fixed a glitch in the code controlling spawning of merchants, which meant Joluv sometimes didn't spawn

<li>Revamped the hostile copies of the party summoned by various creatures, using a method worked out and coded by Ardanis. It should all work much more smoothly, and be more bug-resistant and compatibility-friendly, now;
it will also be slightly harder, as clones of party spellcasters no longer lose their highest-level spells

priestt spells are Cause Critical Wounds, Cause Serious Wounds, Conjure Air Elemental, Create Undead, Sphere of Chaos,

<li>Corrected a bug where necromancers got access to Cacofiend if and only if they weren't liches (exactly the opposite was intended)
<li>Fixed a bug in "smarter vampires" that was incorrectly setting the hit points for the weakest vampires, and which could
cause install failure with some mods (e.g. Gavin)
<li>Removed (harmless) double-compilation of Smarter Abazigal's script (thanks to Ardanis for spotting this)

<li>Removed a typo that was preventing SCSII efreeti overriding Quest Pack efreeti (thanks, ScuD)
<li>Priest spellcasting is no longer prevented by effects that give mages a casting-failure chance (this was causing problems in mods that allow armour to be worn by mages with spellcasting failure chances)

working when QP was installed)

<li>Multi-class fighters no longer get illegal numbers of proficiencies
<li>Some remarkably badly-written code to handle golems and insta-kill weapons has been removed (it was causing crashes with Crom Faeyr
and the Golem Smiting Rod). Golems no longer get immunity to vorpal weapons as a result: the systematic work to make this possible is more in
the scope of an item-revision mod.

<li>Corrected a typo that was preventing clerics from using Summon Elementals correctly
<li>"Make HLAs innate" component no longer removes HLAs from multi-class characters

<li>Fighter proficiency mod now checks (a bit crudely) to see if any other mod has changed the proficiency rules
<li>If Fixpack isn't installed, the Slower Reputation Increase component runs Fixpack's stable of dialog compilation fixes. (This should cut down on large numbers of harmless warnings)
<li>Slower Reputation component no longer chokes if other mods have corrupted scripts, and generally runs a bit more smoothly (thanks to TheBigg for help coding this)
<li>Antimagic spells should now work correctly if both SCSII and SR are installed

</ul>
<p>V 19 (April 2011):</p>
Updated French and Italian translations.
<p>V 20 (November 2011):</p>

<li>Added new auto-install options.</li>
</ul>
<b>Minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Ease of Use AI no longer autocasts Minute Meteors for fighter-mages, bards, and fighter-mage-thieves.</li>
<li>Ease of Use AI no longer breaks Sanctuary to attack.</li>
<li>Good-aligned spellcasters no longer summon fiends.</li>
<li>Way back at the start of the mod, I took a decision to remove Haste from Mariliths. I now think this may have been a mistake; it's reverted.</li>
<li>Archers no longer retreat when they're out of ammo. (Thanks to Polytope for pointing out a nice way to implement this; I've wanted to do it for ages.)</li>
<li>Mages who summon monsters now hopefully don't get so confused by invisible characters.</li>
<li>Fighters are more careful only to use HLAs when there's an appropriate target.</li>
<li>Significantly shortened the duration of vampires' blood drain effect.</li>
<li>Tweaked vampires to use their wolf form slightly more often.</li>
<li>Minor vampire tweaks and optimisations.</li>
<li>Added a .ini option to switch off automatic adjustments to mage and priest levels.</li>
<li>"Improved Minor Encounters" now modifies the muggers at the Docks so they're thieves (not Fighter/Thieves) and they don't respawn endlessly.</li>
<li><em>Slight</em> reduction, and randomization, in number of thieves' Invisibility potions.</li>
<li>Captain Haegan now gets smarter AI and a help script.</li>
<li>Potions of Magic Shielding are now a bit rarer.</li>
<li>Tweaked mages to prioritise direct-attack magic slightly more.</li>
<li>Mages use area-control magic a bit less readily.</li>
<li>If HLAs are made innate, Projected Images no longer get them.</li>
<li>Balor vorpal blade now has 20% chance to make killing strike (there's still a saving throw).</li>
<li>In deference to Alesia_BH's observations about the economics of crime, the ordinary muggers at the docks don't get potions. (Their leader still does.)</li>
<li>Minor streamlining of the "improved Ust Natha defences" option of Improved Drow. (Ordinary drow no longer get smarter AI, which should speed things up.)</li>
<li>Disabled Demogorgons "summon infernal host" (you can re-enable it at the console).</li>
<li>Melissan's stoneskin (also used by Demogorgon) is now conventionally dispellable (previously it was vulnerable to anti-magic attacks rather than Breach et al).</li>
<li>We now check for berserker rage before using Imprisonment or Maze.</li>
<li>We experiment with using Wing Buffet a little less often.</li>

<li>Updated ToBEx to version 21. This should fix the problem with magic damage resistance and Harm, and should generally increase stability.</li></li>
<li>We fix the broken slayer change caused if you install Fixpack after Ascension. This doesn't have anything to do with SCSII but I'm bored of being blamed for it. (And neither Ascension nor Fixpack is currently being updated.)</li>
<li>Updated WEIDU to version 231.</li>
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a variety of crashes and glitches by updating ToBEx</li>

<li>Vampires in mist form no longer cause crashes</li>
<li>Vampires no longer use their powers prior to seeing the party.</li>

<li>Readme now makes clear that the locations of the extra scrolls introduced by the eponymous component are determined randomly.</li>
<li>Tweak to the way Smarter Mages handles clones, to make the code that handles PC summons a bit more robust.</li>
<li>Vampire-summoned rats hopefully no longer approach invisible characters.</li>
<li>Vampires in Brynnlaw no longer turn into bats and flee (this fixes a vanilla-game bug which comes up more frequently with "Smarter Vampires" installed)</li>
<li>Mages who summon monsters now hopefully don't get so confused by invisible characters.</li>
<li>The Huntress and Xei Win weren't getting their AI improved by "Smarter AI".</li>
<li>Fixed some typos that were preventing Avenger spells from being chosen correctly (thanks, ScuD).</li>
<li>Fixed some typos in Smarter Mages. (Thanks, ScuD.)</li>
<li>Berserkers and Barbarians with HLAs now use their rage correctly. (Thanks, ScuD.)</li>
<li>Fixed a glitch in the fighter-proficiency code that was confusing some PCs and disrupting cutscenes. (Thanks, Polytope.)</li>
<li>Barbarians now get correct rage. (Thanks, Polytope.)</li>
<li>Certain NPCs (notably, those in the Govt. District, in Bodhi's Lair, in Saradush Crypts, and in Garren's Hut) no longer run out of the area and break things.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where the code in some places (notably, Smarter General AI) wasn't correctly identifying some creatures as party-joinable (those with DVs longer 
than 8 characters, e.g. Haer'dalis, were being skipped.) This may fix the intermittent bug with Haer'dalis attacking party members.</li>
<li>Udalon no longer attacks the party if they buff in her lair.</li>
<li>Dao genies now go hostile if attacked.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the code that identifies creatures who don't get the new general AI scripts. (This fixes the problem with illusory werewolves doing real damage.)</li>
<li>We now slightly-more-systematically remove scripts from polymorph templates.</li>
<li>Sorted out some glitches that sometimes prevented "Make Watchers' Keep accessible between SoA and ToB" from working properly.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug in the code that prevents certain special creatures from getting potions.</li>
<li>A couple of spellcasters weren't getting their HLAs set correctly if "HLAs as innate" was installed.</li>
<li>A logic error was preventing mages using Melf's Minute Meteors and Energy Blades.</li>
<li>If Option 1 for Smarter Priests was installed, in certain (rare) circumstances priests would re-buff every time you went out of sight. (This is an old bug long fixed for mages; for some reason I didn't replicate the fix for priests.)</li>
<li>A glitch in "improved Sahuagin" was causing them not to get the right proficiencies.</li>
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the level-50 mod was causing incompatibilities with "More sensible choices of weapon proficiencies and kits for fighters"; we now allow for this. (Thanks, Ardanis.)</li>
<li>We now detect Spell-Revisions modifications to the game engine and try to avoid breaking those fixes via ToBEx.</li>
<li>Added a .ini option to prevent SCSII mages from using SR spells (this might help compatibility for people who play with some but not all SR spells).</li>
</ul>
<p>V 21 (June 2012):</p>
<b>New or heavily modified content</b>
<ul>
</ul>
<b>Minor tweaks, optimisations, and additions</b>
<ul>
<li>Updated ToBEx to version 23. This should fix a variety of glitches, notably with some death animations.
<li>Updated French translation, by Mornagest.
<li>Updated Russian translation, by Prowler.
<li>Following suggestions by polytope, slightly tweaked the targetting on fighter HLA use.
<li>We now experiment with spacing out use of Timestops a bit.
<li>We make some attempt to react to offscreen casting of disabling spells (following suggestion by Topos).
</ul>
<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Beholders with vanilla-game antimagic rays now use them. (Thanks to Topos for spotting this.)
<li>The "golem" defending the door out of the underdark is only affected by Improved Golems if it actually is a golem. (It's turned into a golem by the Improved Drow City component, but Improved Golems was affecting it even if this component wasn't installed.) Thanks to Wisp for spotting this.
<li>The "summon elemental prince" spells in Smarter Priests are no longer being corrupted. (Thanks to Wisp for picking this up.)
<li>In the improved Abazigal's lair, black dragon immunities weren't working properly due to a typo, and lizard man shamans weren't being correctly flagged as cleric/mages. (Thanks, Ardanis.)
<li>The hidden fiends in Sendai's lair are now correctly taken from Smarter Fiends' list of modified fiends. (Thanks, Ardanis.)
<li>Fixed a bunch of typos in the English translation files, identified by hook71.
<li>Melissan's blade barrier is now affected by the party-friendly blade barrier component.
<li>Corrected a typo in the "improve reputation" part of the auto-installer. (Thanks to phuongww11 for catching this.)
<li>Fixed a bug in the Improved Vampires script that was preventing them from shapeshifting into rat form.
<li>In some circumstances, vampires were trying to trigger various animations in mist form (and so crashing the game); hopefully they no longer do.
<li>"Improved Vampires" now tightens up the logic of the Sime/Saemon autosave on arriving at Spellhold. (This isn't directly anything to do with SCSII, but it's made more visible by Improved Vampires.)
<li>Haegan no longer sits around like an idiot. (Subtle interaction of new and old code... I really need to recode this thing.)
<li>We now systematically enforce the requirement that the Initialise component is installed; allowing it not to be causes instabilities when it's uninstalled. (Power users can disable this by putting "dw#AIsetup.mrk" in the override... but, as Weimer used to say, Don't Do This.)
<li>Liches no longer cast Minor Globe (thanks to Topos for catching this).
</ul>
<b>Compatibility fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a typo in scsii.ini that was breaking SR compatibility.
<li>"Improved proficiencies for fighters" component now skips any fighter with a corrupt Effects offset. (This was breaking compatibility with Amber, in which M#YCLBM1.cre is corrupt).
<li>Added a couple more checks for corrupt files in patch-everything components.
<li>Spell Revisions' "Summon Shadow" and "Create Undead" spells were being confused with each other by the spell autoselector in "Smarter Mages".
<li>We now enforce the requirement that aTweaks "Smarter Fiends" is installed <b>after</b>SCSII.
<li>Move-Boo components are now properly synchronised across SCS and SCSII.
</ul>
